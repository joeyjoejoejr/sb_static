              p We are all about ideas, disruption, innovation, and pushing technology boundaries daily. The box is a classic archetype that represents a dilemma in people’s thinking. It is a constraint, yet it is also an opportunity. You don’t have to stay in a box, and you don’t have to necessarily think “outside of the box”. When there IS NO BOX, you are free to build the solution that best meets your needs with no restrictions.
