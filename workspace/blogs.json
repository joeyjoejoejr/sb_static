If you prefer Gmail for example, \u003Ca title=\"Google Apps\" href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGoogle Apps for Business\u003C/a\u003E has always been a good choice and was free for small organizations until recently. \u003Ca title=\"Google Blog\" href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2012/12/changes-to-google-apps-for-businesses.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGoogle\u0026nbsp;Apps just switched\u003C/a\u003E to a paid-only business model which may be a good thing for those who want quality service above all. Their service is now $50 per user, per year and comes with 5GB of storage, which is not a bad deal considering the importance of email. If having the best email experience in a web interface is your concern, Google is the leader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp id=\"attachment_2218\" style=\"width: 310px; text-align: center;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-2218 \" alt=\"Gmail\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gmail-300x191.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\r\n\tGoogle Apps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWeb or Desktop\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIf Google rules the web client arena, what other choices are worth considering? Fortunately,there are a multitude of other web clients including a few\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca title=\"Roundcube\" href=\"http://roundcube.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eopen\u003C/a\u003E source \u003Ca title=\"Zimbra\" href=\"http://www.zimbra.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Echoices\u003C/a\u003E. Unfortunately, none of the alternatives have proven very competitive with Google, which provides both the email service and the web client. Additionally, Google allows plenty of integration with services such as documents, Google+, and of course the Android mobile OS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIf access from a web browser is not so important, there are some excellent desktop clients. \u003Ca title=\"Thunderbird\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThunderbird\u003C/a\u003E is a great open source choice available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

Often, the only method for small to medium-sized businesses to find an email provider is similar to how an individual would find an Internet service provider (ISP) for access to the Web. Other than Google Apps, an email service that includes a web client, what choices are there? Well, there are many free or inexpensive options, most of which are traditional email hosts such as Yahoo!, Gmail, Hotmail, or even your ISP’s included email service. These options are usually not suitable for businesses that care about reliability and premium support options. For more professional service there is \u003Ca title=\"FastMail\" href=\"https://www.fastmail.fm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EFastMail\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca title=\"Rackspace email\" href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERackspace Email\u003C/a\u003E, and again, Google Apps.

But having an email client and server is still not the end of the story for many business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EEmail-enabled apps\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOk, so you set up your business email using your favorite client. But now you want your web or mobile application to send emails to users when they forget their password or to notify them about a new feature. Can’t you just use the email server you’re already paying for? Unfortunately, typical email services don’t interface well with web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. The reason is that Rails servers are busy serving up web pages or mobile app calls. At the very least, a Rails app would need to create a background job to handle the email delivery. But what if the job fails? Rails does not automatically resend failed messages. So you’re suddenly talking about building a lot of email-related infrastructure around your web app, just to handle email delivery. Luckily, there are great solutions out there for email delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca title=\"Sendgrid\" href=\"http://sendgrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESendgrid\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca title=\"Mailgun\" href=\"http://www.mailgun.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EMailgun\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca title=\"Postmarkapp\" href=\"http://postmarkapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EPostmarkapp\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca title=\"AWS SES\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ses/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAmazon Simple Email Service\u003C/a\u003E are all notable email delivery services. These services complete much of the heavy lifting involved with reliable email delivery for you. Their capabilities include things like email signing, making sure server IP addresses are \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist#Email_whitelists\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ewhite-listed\u003C/a\u003E by spam filters, and monitoring deliveries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESendgrid\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSendgrid has been around the longest of the bunch. Founded way back in 2009 it delivers email for large sites such as Quora. Currently, $80 per month with Sendgrid secures a package that includes custom DKIM signing (allowing you to send \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Everified emails\u003C/a\u003E from your domain). It has an \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESMTP\u003C/a\u003E interface for traditional clients as well as a Web API for modern apps. Sendgrid also has a few unique features like delivery tracking and reputation monitoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EMailgun\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tMailgun provides a similar service to Sendgrid for $59 per month. Sendgrid’s $80 package advertises multiple IP addresses while Mailgun’s $59 plan states it uses dedicated IP addresses. It’s hard to say which is better and both companies seem to have good domain experience in the field of email delivery. Smashing Boxes has used both Sendgrid and Mailgun for projects and I would say they are quite comparable, although I slightly prefer Mailgun because it seems more developer friendly. Specifically, Mailgun’s documentation has examples in multiple programming languages for all of their API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAmazon Simple Email Service\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tA relative newcomer, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) was introduced at the beginning of 2011. It is strictly a pay-as-you-go service. The prices are affordable at $0.10 per thousand messages and $0.12 per gigabyte of transfer after the first gigabyte. That means that for most business, SES will be significantly cheaper than Sendgrid or Mailgun. However, SES is as it’s name implies, simple. There are no extra features like delivery, click, or open tracking. It’s just a bare-bones delivery service and the documentation is not as stellar as Mailgun’s. But if delivery cost is your overarching concern, then SES may be the best choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EReceiving email\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhat if your web application not only needs to send email, but also needs to be able to receive email replies and parse them? Both Sendgrid and Mailgun support this feature. Amazon SES does not. Receiving email and automatically parsing it to provide meaningful data to a web app is not trivial and will take more development time. But beware, if you think your app needs both to send and receive email, you may be succumbing to \u003Ca title=\"Zawinski's Law\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski.27s_law_of_software_envelopment\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EZawinsky’s Law\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSometimes email should just be left out of a web application in favor of a better application design that sufficiently models workflows to the point that outside communication is largely unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tChoosing an email client, server, and delivery service is crucial to many businesses’ online presence. Without reliable email services you or your users may be left out of the loop when it comes to workflows that involve email notification. Which services you choose depends largely on your organization’s users and the requirements of your application. Once again Amazon Web Services is a low-cost leader and a good choice if you want to keep most of your services under one account. Pair that with Google Apps for Business and you will have a complete email solution for your organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

I wanted to build a simple app where people could vote for beer by ranking their favorites on a weighted 1 to N scale. However, I was unsure how Ember would handle a major component of the app: drag-n-drop.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I will go into more detail about how I implemented HTML5 drag-n-drop functionality for updating beer rankings. I will demonstrate how simple it was to build this functionality into my existing, non-dynamic list of beers.\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/1e1D0m0J161V/Image%202014-12-03%20at%209.53.45%20AM.png)\r\n##VS\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/1D2Q1y191W1o0C3V200s/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-10%20at%2010.27%20AM.gif)\r\n\r\n##Bootstrapping\r\n\r\nI love to use twitter bootstrap when I am prototyping a new idea. Just run...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bower install --save-dev ember-cli-bootstrap-sass\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then add the following to the top of your root scss stylesheet:\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/styles/app.scss**\r\n\r\n```\r\n@import \"bootstrap\";\r\n@import \"bootstrap/theme\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Drag-N-Drop\r\n\r\nWe've all heard this request before: \"I just want to be able to drag this item _here_ and this item _there_ and POOF, the change is made!\" Clients LOVE drag-n-drop. It is a feature I have implemented a million times before, but I almost **always** use some JQuery library that interfaces with a custom-built API for the sole purpose of building that ONE drag-n-drop component. I was seriously scared that drag-n-drop would be really hard to build in **pure** Ember, but I am pleased to say that I had it up and running in no time!\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was hit the [docs](http://emberjs.com/api/). I was pleased to see that `EmberView` [supports drag and drop out of the box](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.View.html#toc_event-names). This worked out perfectly, since I knew I would need two views in this component: a line item and a slot to drop each line item into. So, I created myself a `line-item` and an `item-slot` view with the necessary `event dataTransfer` data.\r\n\r\nI had to comb through the w3c spec a bit, but I was able to come up with [some solid documentation on HTML5 drag-n-drop and the data transfer interface](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/dnd.html#the-datatransfer-interface).\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/views/line-item.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.View.extend({\r\n  attributeBindings: ['draggable'],\r\n  draggable: 'true',\r\n  templateName: 'line-item',\r\n  classNames: 'line_item',\r\n\r\n  dragStart: function(ev){\r\n    var dragData = { id: this.content.get('id') };\r\n    ev.dataTransfer.setData('application/json', JSON.stringify(dragData));\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/templates/line-item.hbs**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003Cspan class='weight'\u003E{{weight}}\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\u003Cspan class='name'\u003E{{beer_name}}\u003C/span\u003E\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/views/item-slot.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.View.extend({\r\n  templateName: 'item-slot',\r\n\r\n  dragOver: function(ev){\r\n    ev.preventDefault();\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  drop: function(ev){\r\n    var data = JSON.parse(ev.dataTransfer.getData('application/json'));\r\n    this.get('controller').send('swap', data.id, this.content.get('id'));\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/templates/item-slot.hbs**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{{view 'line-item' contentBinding='this'}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, I updated my ballot template to use these new views.\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/templates/ballot.hbs**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{{#each this.model.sorted_line_items}}\r\n  \u003Cdiv class='row'\u003E\r\n    \u003Cdiv class='col-xs-12'\u003E\r\n      {{view 'item-slot' contentBinding='this'}}\r\n    \u003C/div\u003E\r\n  \u003C/div\u003E\r\n{{/each}}\r\n\u003Cdiv class='row'\u003E\r\n  \u003Cdiv class='col-xs-12 new_beer'\u003E\r\n    {{#view 'new-beer' contentBinding='this'}}\r\n      \u003Cinput type='text' placeholder='+ ADD BEER'/\u003E\r\n    {{/view}}\r\n  \u003C/div\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I update my controller to handle swapping of weights between two line items. It's a little dirty, but it gets the job done:\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/controller/ballot.js**\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\r\n  sortProperties: ['weight'],\r\n\r\n  actions: {\r\n    swap: function(line_item_id_1, line_item_id_2) {\r\n      var li1, li1_weight, li2, li2_weight;\r\n      li1 = this.model.get('line_items').findBy('id', line_item_id_1);\r\n      li2 = this.model.get('line_items').findBy('id', line_item_id_2);\r\n      li1_weight = li1.get('weight');\r\n      li2_weight = li2.get('weight');\r\n      li1.set('weight', li2_weight);\r\n      li2.set('weight', li1_weight);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat’s it, drag-n-drop now works! Yet again Ember proves itself to be an amazing framework for building incredibly dynamic single-page apps with great speed.\r\n\r\nIn [Part 3]( http://smashingboxes.com/_/35cf7), I will show you how to persist these changes that you make to your backend Rails application!\r\n\r\n##Resources\r\n* [Ember-CLI Rails Github Repo](https://github.com/smashingboxes/blog-mergin_rails_ember_cli)\r\n* [HTML5 Drag and Drop](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20101019/dnd.html)\r\n* [Part I](http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli)\r\n* [Part 3]( http://smashingboxes.com/_/35cf7)\r\n\r\n*Cover photo by  [OUCHcharley](https://www.flickr.com/photos/g-ratphotos/)*\r\n","image_alt_text":"Merging Rails and Ember-CLI","featured":false},{"id":386,"title":"Smashing Boxes Apprenticeship ","summary":"In this 12-week program, you’ll be paid to hone your skills as a professional Ruby on Rails developer, learning advanced programming concepts through the practical application of the Ruby language. \r\nUpon completion and with your newly honed skills in hand, you will be hired by Smashing Boxes as a Junior Developer.

Our hope is that many of our apprentices will grow into mentors themselves for future generations.\r\n\r\n###What Is It Like To Work at SB?\r\n\r\nOne of our programmers, Zach Kuhn, says it best in [this article](https://medium.com/@zacharykuhn/my-first-two-weeks-at-smashing-boxes-549559e6c4d) recapping his first two weeks at Smashing Boxes.\r\n\r\n###Timeline\r\n\r\n*July 27 from 5-6:30pm - Info Session at Smashing Boxes \r\n\r\n*July 30 - Submissions due by 5pm (see how to apply below)\r\n\r\n* August 3- 4 - Interviews take place at Smashing Boxes\r\n\r\n* August 5-7 - Offers awarded \r\n\r\n* August 11 - Apprenticeship program begins\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n\r\n* Graduation from a full-time, accredited code school (or) a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (or) equivalent professional programming experience is required for admission into our apprenticeship program. \r\n\r\n* Applicants are asked to submit their resume or LinkedIn profile and a link to their GitHub account, personal blog, or portfolio.\r\n\r\n* Qualified applicants will be invited to our office for an interview with our development team. \r\n\r\n###How To Apply\r\n\r\nPlease send the above to [careers@smashingboxes.com](mailto: careers@smashingboxes.com) with the subject line: SB Apprenticeship \r\n\r\n\r\n","image_alt_text":"smashing boxes employees ","featured":false},{"id":230,"title":"The Impact of Healthcare IT:  Entrepreneurial Vistas","summary":"The third and final installment of an interview series with Dr. Mark Braunstein, Director of the Health Systems Institute at Georgia Tech, and columnist at InformationWeek.

Recent advances in technology, combined with the sweeping overhauls coming with the Affordable Care Act, there has been no better time for entrepreneurs to grab the horns and ride this opportunity to success. Dr. Braunstein offers some insight into where one should start when looking for these opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tHealth Engagement: \u003Cem\u003EGo Mobile\u003C/em\u003E\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAccording to Braunstein, an important way for entrepreneurs to get a foothold is to look at the population of patients.  “When patients need to see multiple specialists and comply with 3 or often more different doctors’ orders, following those orders can be a very difficult task,” said Braunstein. “New mobile apps make it easier to engage with your provider – and the insurance company. New apps are released regularly, but no one really owns that market yet. There’s still great opportunity for the company that finds an engagement method that really keeps people enthused.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThere are a lot of mobile apps touting healthcare as their category. But a study came out in October of 2013 pointing out that, of the 43,000+ classified as mobile health apps, only 23,682 performed a legitimate health function. In other words, there is a lot of ‘junk’ and therefore a lot of opportunity. If you’re looking for insight on what apps might still have market value, the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics has a lot of inspiring data for you. I found \u003Ca href=\"http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/imshealth/Global/Content/Corporate/IMS%20Health%20Institute/Reports/Patient_Apps/IIHI_Patient_Apps_Report.pdf\"\u003Ethis pdf\u003C/a\u003E to be particularly interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBut according to Braunstein, the Holy Grail for mobile healthcare apps remains the ability to engage. The two most popular categories at this time address changing patient behavior (diet, exercise, etc.) and improving how consumers follow their prescribed treatment regimen. The real trick for success in either of these categories is to find a way to keep the consumer engaged.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003E(editor’s note: watch for a new white paper from Smashing Boxes on mobile health and medication non-adherence)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\te-Records: \u003Cem\u003EGo Cloud\u003C/em\u003E\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tNot surprisingly, Braunstein is bullish on the opportunities for entrepreneurs in the world of electronic records management, sometimes called EHR or EMR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t“Here’s a picture of where the growth will come from,” he says, as he leads us down through the recent history of medical records. “Right now, only 50% of primary care doctors are committed to implementing systems that require health care records be posted to EMR systems.  Only 75% of hospitals have thoroughly implemented a system. These doctors will soon have to get on board or part ways with their networks, because it will all be electronic in the near future.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tEvery organization that undertakes patient care across the country is moving or has moved to an electronic healthcare records management system.  Opportunities continue to abound, however. Many aspects of the care system have yet to be ‘plugged in.’ The incentive to change habits and expenditures is now in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSome estimate that healthcare technology is a $30 Billion industry – with room to grow. Those funding new companies understand this and are looking for better ways to use data and to engage patients\u0026hellip; especially as doctors are now required to share data with patients. The cost of providing healthcare will drop significantly when the financial incentive is put into place, because not only does technology positively impact lower cost for care, but also more superior results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tWhere to look for ideas\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe best way to find a real market need is to clearly understand the needs of the market!  Braunstein suggested that some upstarts might begin with where the money is today: Medicare/Medicaid. Opportunities become clear once you get to know the concerns of the more than 300 \u003Ca href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ACO/index.html?redirect=/ACO/\"\u003EAccountable Care Organizations\u003C/a\u003E that are within the United States today. These groups of doctors, hospitals and other patient care organizations have come together voluntarily in order to give high quality, highly coordinated patient care. They are changing the way care is given today – and it’s the technology behind their work that’s allowing for that change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt might help for aspiring entrepreneurs to look into the field of Healthcare IT before thinking about the business they might start. In fact – it pays pretty well, as burgeoning fields often do. According to a \u003Ca href=\"http://www.ihealthbeat.org/picture-of-health/2014/what-is-the-average-health-it-salary-throughout-the-us\"\u003EJanuary 14\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E, 2014 report\u003C/a\u003E from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, the average salary for Healthcare IT pros is $113,000 per year.

Spreading your germs to the other kids on the playground was a surefire bet to get them sick and result in an angry parent cursing under their breath at your mother for not raising you properly. In today’s world of content marketing, things work a little differently. You want those germs to spread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBy disseminating your knowledge to one person through social networking and digital relationship building, it can be passed on to lots of other people.

Here’s a tip: you don’t have to write. If you’re a designer, post sketches of your latest logo or infographic and explain where they idea came from. UX designer? Push out your wireframes and discuss your usability testing (if you can make it public). Film a short video. Record a podcast.

Own your topic. \u003C/strong\u003EOn an individual level, this may mean owning your own personal talent. What are you uniquely good at? What area do you want to be seen as an expert in? Whether it’s design, front-end development, UX, whatever, be vocal within those communities and see what personal or unique spin you can offer. Be disruptive.

Who cares. \u003C/strong\u003EBut really, who cares? Every good marketer knows the importance of appealing to their target audience. But you’re going to want to look past the standard “men, women, ages 25-35, black, white, dual income etc.” obligatoriness. Ask yourself, “are we putting this content out for a startup of 10 people? Or a massive company with 10,000 people that has money to work with?” Don’t just talk to your audience to try and grab their attention, speak to them directly and find their pain points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://pizzaturnaround.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EDomino’s Pizza did this\u003C/a\u003E in 2011 when they started seeing complaints on social media regarding their product.

Instead of re-targeting its brand message, Domino’s spoke to their customers directly and literally, apologizing for the dissatisfaction and reconfigured its entire recipe book to make better-tasting pies.

Share the love. \u003C/strong\u003EYou can tweet out your thoughts a million times over or even strike up a conversation on Google+, but if you’re not spreading your ideas with similar and influential networks, you might as well be eating chicken noodle soup by yourself.

It’s fascinating to observe as they work through updating and improving their applications to make them more appealing to a large and diverse group of people engaging on different platforms contexts. The degree to which they’ve succeeded is impressive, but that’s not to say that every decision makes sense to an end user. Particularly, without the benefit of having been a part of the research, observation, and iteration that led to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on my understanding of the vision driving Twitter, the ability of a user to follow and be followed by other users is second in importance only to the user’s ability to send tweets. Without the concept of following, Twitter devolves into a mob of people shouting at each other.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat’s why I was surprised by the design team’s decision to hide the Follow button while scrolling through another user’s timeline on Android and iOS devices (web maintains the button’s visibility). Depending on the height of the user’s device and the length of the most recent tweets, a mobile user will typically be able to read around three (but as few as one) tweets before scrolling the Follow button off the top of the screen.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/TartTerribleCrocodile\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);padding-left:0.65rem\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\"\u003E\r\n\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;margin-top:-1rem\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECurrent review and follow interaction with disappearing Follow button\u003C/em\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperience Failure?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo one to three tweets provide enough information to make a decision on whether to follow another user? In some cases, yes. Personally, and for a handful of other users I asked during an informal research session (details below), the answer is no. During that research session, three general follow scenarios emerged:\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli\u003E“A friend recommended that I follow a particular user, so I am going to follow him or her.

This desire to learn more coupled with limited viewable tweets on a mobile screen means that scrolling through the timeline is likely before a decision to follow is made. If the potential follower scrolls 10, 20, 50 tweets down before deciding to follow, he or she must subsequently remember that the follow button exists, remember where it is (after potentially trying to discover it somewhere on-screen), and then scroll back to the top of the profile before again locating and tapping the Follow button. That’s significant thinking and interaction between decision and action, and ample opportunity for an experience failure.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\"\u003EReaching out\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the insights gained from my personal use patterns and informal research, I assume the decision to scroll the Follow button away was explicit and arrived at after extensive research, observation, and testing, which serves only to further pique my interest.

This also appears to be the option least disruptive to the UI, especially given my lack of direct knowledge of the research, business goals, etc. that helped to determine the current design, and the easiest for the development team to implement.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally like some aspects of option 2 as I find the tweet count by itself lacking in useful or actionable information. Also, breaking up that history back button would reduce the number of unexpected returns to the main timeline. That option, however, has its own issues related to visibility and button consistency. Option 3 is the quickest of quick fixes and should be used only as a stop-gap measure, if at all.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\"\u003EHunting For Deeper Meaning\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI’m confident in the above recommendation as a solution to the discrete issue of the disappearing Follow button but, again, am intensely curious as to the thinking and requirements that led to the UI’s current behavior. Looked at in a vacuum, just about any design decision can be second guessed, and the maturity of a designer or design team can be measured by its ability to accept a superficial design flaw in service to a deeper design or business goal.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf @design or anyone else has additional insight into this aspect of the UI or would like to point out something blatantly obvious that I missed, I’d love to continue the conversation \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://twitter.com/dantepassera\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eon Twitter\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E or in the comments below.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECover photo by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkhmarketing/\" class=\"owner-name truncate\" title=\"Go to mkhmarketing's photostream\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" data-rapid_p=\"35\"\u003Emkhmarketing\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/em\u003E","slug":"twitter-app-design","slug_history":["new-blog-post"],"visits":1271,"published_at":"2015-07-14T04:00:00.000-04:00","author_name":"","category_id":3,"image_uid":"2015/07/14/15/36/12/156/file","created_at":"2015-07-08T12:26:17.883-04:00","updated_at":"2015-07-14T15:39:57.921-04:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":"twitter app design","featured":true},{"id":247,"title":"Scalable CSS","summary":"“Easy to make larger, more powerful, etc” – Merriam-Webster Dictionary When I first started making websites, one of my most enjoyable steps in development was creating the visuals.

Normally, these are single and pseudo element selectors that set the general style for the whole site. Typical elements and styling here would be setting the link colors, the heading font sizes, or the paragraph line height. Here is an example:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003Ea { text-decoration: none; color: blue }\r\nh1 { font-size: 2em; color: blue }\r\nh2 { font-size: 1.5em; color: lightblue }\r\np { line-height: 3px }\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tYou could also reset styles here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tLayout\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tHere we set the layout styles.

Examples of these are the navigational menu that lives inside the header, the Twitter feed that lives in the sidebar, and the website info that lives inside the footer.

One such feature is nested selectors. This makes stylesheets shorter. However be careful not to nest too deep as this can cause confusion and conflicts. Here is an example of SASS modified from the example above:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E.nav {\r\n  li.hidden {\r\n     display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.nav {\r\n  li.expanded {\r\n    display: block;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tFrameworks\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tA Web Framework is great as it does the heavy lifting for you.

A key job of a designer is to make sure they create something that is not only easily accessible and used by the user, but also accessible on any platform that best reaches the user. To do this in the ancient days of the web, we would have to create separate pages and even separate sites for a user to access a site or application on their phone and other devices. But now-a-days, we’ve simplified that process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn Today’s web, we integrate everything into one site. Why? This minimizes the page load and loading time between multiple devices, as well as makes it functional for the user no matter where they may be and what platform they may be using. People can access a site that is on a computer as well as by phones and other devices. If we didn’t use responsive design, the user would be given one big site that fails to look functional on their screen. They would have to zoom in and pray that they click the right link or button, squinting to read any information you are trying to provide to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWith Responsive Design, we fix this problem. A site that looks good on a computer, will also look good on a tablet and phone, no matter the screen size. We alter the sizes of images and fonts, so they can be properly displayed on the providing screen. And lets face it, with computer screens being as big as they are, we tend to add a bit of extra design and functionality to the page, so that the user can have a decent experience. However, the tools a laptop may provide aren’t necessarily provided with a phone or tablet. We don’t have a mouse to look around and click. We don’t have a massive screen to view things on. When our screen minimizes, so does our functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tExample: Many big sites these days have Drop down menus. The issue? A phone does not have enough room to have a giant drop-down, much less list all the options across the top of our page. Additionally, phones do not have a mouse that allows easy downward scrolling while that drop-down is open. Solution? Create a drop-down that works on the users desktop or laptop computer, but also minimizes into a pop-out sidebar or options list when it gets to a smaller height. This way the user can just use their finger to navigate throughout the site with ease, but still have a successful experience on their computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tWhat are some of the positive effects?\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWell, for one, your client will be happy. Instead of having to make several side pages and sites like we used to, we can incorporate everything on one site or page that works on all platforms. This means less money out of your clients’ pockets, preventing them from having to pay for extra server space and urls. The mobility that you provide will satisfy users of the site. Instead of having to be redirected, they just go straight to the site and use the app as intended. You get to write less code and have less to manage, saving more money for your client and you have more time to spend on more important things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tHow do I use Responsive Design?\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe next step in the process is Media Queries. Media Queries are CSS-based and they’re handy little wrappers that allow you to add/remove or even change a page’s design based on the device’s screen width. No more having to use JavaScript to detect the size of your browser. The Media Queries do this for you and actually help you minimize the amount of JavaScript you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/responsive-design-layout.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/responsive-design-layout-300x225.png\" alt=\"responsive design\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4587\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003EPercentages and Ems\u003C/em\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tInstead of using a specific width, (960px sound familiar?), we want to retain flexibility throughout all devices. This is where it would help to better understand percentages and ems. These two things will help change your element sizes based off of certain factors; how big your screen is being the biggest one. However, one specific percentage still may not look good on other devices. Fifty percent for a phone is much more different than fifty percent on a desktop screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003EMedia Queries\u003C/em\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn the event that something looks wrong on a different screen-size, Media Queries will jump into play. Media Queries are used within your CSS to detect screen-size and even type. They even cover whether the user’s phone or tablet may be in landscape mode or portrait mode. After detecting all this information, you can pass some CSS through the Media Query to go to this device only. This disables or overwrites styles you may need to change or don’t need at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is an Example Media Query:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"\u003E\u0026lt;link href=\"css/medium.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"screen \r\nand (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 900px)\" /\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAs you can see, we’re targeting any screen, with a minimum width of 701px and a max width of 900 px. This means that any device with a detectable screen between the widths of 701px and 900 px will be using this CSS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tTo make things easier, there are many sources out there for you to build responsively. The most convenient resources are frameworks that were built out to be responsive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tTwo of the best frameworks are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\"\u003EZurb Foundation\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\"\u003EBootstrap\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAdditional resources:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://mattkersley.com/responsive/\"\u003EResponsive Design Test\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://getwirefy.com/\"\u003EWirefy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://adaptive-images.com/\"\u003EAdaptive Images\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://gridsetapp.com/\"\u003EGridset\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://fittextjs.com/\"\u003EFitText\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tResponsive Design is growing at an incredible rate, especially considering the fact that most of the sites you find on the web now are web applications, and not just web-sites.

This can be equivalent to a real-world business or to a field of engineering or math. The domain logic is the representation of the business rules of the domain being modeled.

Our little pet-project blog app is nothing more than a blog. Its business logic is intimately tied to the delivery platform—the web. There is no need to separate out the domain logic. It’s just a simple CRUD app.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBut what happens when your app is more than just a blog? What if your application needs to model complex behavior—say, a payroll app. You have dozens of models and your tests start to take longer and longer with complex database interactions. Then you start wanting to separate out business logic by \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/extracting-domain-objects\"\u003Eextracting domain objects\u003C/a\u003E. You mock or stub out your tests and they are moving fast again. But still, your views and controllers are tightly coupled with your models, reaching far inside to extract data. It can’t all be tested easily except by huge integration tests.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIf those problems sound all too familiar, you might be ready to re-discover some practices and approaches that have worked well in the history of software engineering.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThe Solution: Object-Oriented Design\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt just so happens that what’s needed to speed up our tests is the same things that are good for object-oriented software design. There are a handful of time-tested approaches that can make our applications faster, easier to maintain, and more bug-free. The first principle is single-responsibility. Each class should be responsible for a single concern. Put another way, classes should only have a single reason to change. If a class is responsible for too much it will require frequent changes and make the application more fragile.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tRails’ models, which inherit from ActiveRecord::Base, are responsible for both domain logic and persistence. This is one responsibility too many. So the first step in refactoring a fragile Rails application is putting all domain logic in Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs). Free from the constraints of the database we can now model our domain in a fully object-oriented way. We can use object-oriented design patterns such as inheritance, facades, decorators, and so on. For a full description of many such design patterns a good reference is \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDependency Inversion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe next approach we will explore is creating a boundary that inverts the dependencies between controllers, views, and models. According to Uncle Bob’s \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EClean Architecture\u003C/a\u003E, software dependencies should all point towards higher-level business rules. The database, web, and other external interfaces thus become the lowest-level implementation details. This is the reverse of how Rails applications are often designed. Usually, the database design is considered first and then ActiveRecord models are created with a near one-to-one mapping to database tables. Clean architecture turns that process upside down and has you consider your domain logic far ahead of the database.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOnce you have a test-driven domain object model that begins to fully model and implement your business rules, you can begin to focus on the interfaces that control the boundaries between the web and the actual domain logic.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUse Cases\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe interfaces that interact with the database, web, external services on the one side, and your domain entities on the other side, are called Use Cases. A use case can also be described as a User Story. A use case defines the interaction between a role and part of the system. There are special syntaxes for describing use cases, such as \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://cukes.info/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECucumber\u003C/a\u003E steps. But in simple form a use case can be described in terms such as “a user logging in”, or “a manager adding a new employee”.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn Rails, use cases can be implemented through Interactor models that take request objects passed in through the controller and return response objects that get rendered in the view. The request and response objects are simple data structures with no behavior or logic. Interactors can thus interact with controllers, domain objects, and repositories.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERepositories\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAt this point you may be thinking we’re throwing all of Rails out. But we’re not. In fact, we are going to keep on using ActiveRecord::Base as the base class for our repository models. The name repository implies a data store. So these repository models are responsible only for storing and retrieving data. We can use the full \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EActive Record query interface\u003C/a\u003E if we want to, or drop down into plain SQL. It doesn’t matter how we implement repositories as long as our dependencies point away from them. With inverted depencies our application is loosely coupled and we can freely refactor domain logic without caring about the implementation details of the persistence layer.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4292\" alt=\"clean_rails_diagram\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/clean_rails_diagram.png\" height=\"628\" width=\"600\"\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAn Example in Rails\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWe tried this approach in a Rails app that had already been under development for a few months. The complexity of the domain led us to the decision to refactor away from the traditional Rails way towards this type of clean architecture. Immediately the benefits could be felt when running tests. The old tests were already taking about 30 seconds without too many cases. The new tests run in about a second and we can now freely add new ones without fear of slowing them down. Our domain logic was completely refactored from a database-centric one to a properly object-oriented one. This simplified the many table joins we had to do previously. Now we use object inheritance to group similar concepts and can get the behavior we need without complex database queries.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow it’s Done\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFirst, I started off in a new clean directory and added a lib/ and spec/. Using test-first development, I started creating entities. Entities are where all the domain logic lives. They inherit from a base class called Entity.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cpre\u003Eclass Entity\r\n  include ActiveModel::Validations\r\n  attr_accessor :id\r\n  def self.attr_accessor(*vars)\r\n    @class_attributes ||= [:id]\r\n    @class_attributes.concat vars\r\n    super(*vars)\r\n  end\r\n  def self.class_attributes\r\n    @class_attributes\r\n  end\r\n  def self.inherited(sublass)\r\n    sublass.attr_accessor(*@class_attributes)\r\n  end\r\n  def initialize(attr = {})\r\n    attr.each do |name, value|\r\n      send(\"#{name}=\", value)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n I’m interested in the class and object attributes because it’s convenient for validations.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tNext, I implemented the Interactor base class.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cpre\u003Eclass Interactor\r\n  attr_reader :request, :response\r\n\r\n  def initialize(request = {})\r\n    @request = request\r\n    @response = Response.new\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  private\r\n\r\n  def save_repository(repo_class)\r\n    if @request.params[:id]\r\n      repo = repo_class.find(@request.params[:id])\r\n      repo.update_attributes(@request.object_attributes)\r\n    else\r\n      repo = repo_class.create(@request.object_attributes)\r\n    end\r\n    repo\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def delete(repo_class)\r\n    repo = repo_class.find(@request.params[:id])\r\n    repo.destroy\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nNotice there is a convenience method there used to save data into a repository. It can handle either create or update, depending on the params passed by the controller.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhat do the request and response objects look like?\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThese have some behavior that make it easy to integrate Rails form helpers. For example, a response object that contains an id will be considered as a persisted record by a Rails form and so the form action will be the update url rather than the create url. They both are \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/intridea/hashie\"\u003EHashie::Mash\u003C/a\u003E objects because that makes accessing attributes cleaner.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tNow how does this integrate with Rails? It’s simple. After I finished the basic domain object model and a couple of interactors, I dropped them into the Rails app directory. Be sure to add paths to entities and interactors in your autoload paths in config/application.rb. The application controller loads commonly used data attributes into every request:\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cpre\u003Eclass ApplicationController \u0026lt; ActionController::Base\r\n  before_filter :set_default_request\r\n\r\n  def current_account_id\r\n    @current_account_id ||= current_user.account_repository_id if user_signed_in?\r\n  end\r\n  helper_method :current_account_id\r\n\r\n  protected\r\n\r\n  def set_default_request\r\n    if current_user\r\n      @request = Request.new(current_user: current_user,\r\n                             current_account_id: current_account_id,\r\n                             params: params)\r\n    else\r\n      @request = Request.new(params: params)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tYou’ll see there are still some ActiveRecord associations being used, partly in order to make \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/plataformatec/devise\"\u003EDevise\u003C/a\u003E work.

It offers a clean boundary between application logic and implementation details. It would be quite easy to refactor an app like this into a Sinatra app. Or it could even use a different language for the delivery mechanism. External services should be easy to plugin. Likewise for database backends and ORMs. But most importantly, implementing a Rails app using a clean architecture reminds us to keep up the red-green-refactor TDD cycle and to make sure our models only have a single responsibility. Yes, it is more work this way but this is a case of not being penny wise and pound foolish. We can build seemingly powerful applications very quickly in Rails. But if we want to keep maintaining and refactoring and adding features for years, that initial productivity boost that Rails affords us will quickly run out and leave us with a big ball of mud.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tComment below with your thoughts. \r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003ECover image by \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAlan Levine\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"domain-logic-in-rails","slug_history":[],"visits":15057,"published_at":"2014-12-04T07:09:33.182-05:00","author_name":"Reed Law","category_id":1,"image_uid":"2014/07/28/17/25/40/693/file","created_at":"2014-06-05T14:21:54.641-04:00","updated_at":"2015-06-15T15:12:18.119-04:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":null,"featured":false},{"id":313,"title":"Next Generation Web Framework","summary":"Having been excited about Ruby on Rails since just after its 1.0 release back in late 2005, it’s hard to imagine life without it.

So I got Node running and my first impression was “wow, this is so much faster than Rails; I need to think about refactoring all my apps into Node”. But it didn’t take long to realize that wasn’t going to work. Node.js was missing lots of the things I took for granted with Rails. Things like form helpers and \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\"\u003EMVC architecture\u003C/a\u003E.

None of them seemed to just get things right the way Rails does. Rails is opinionated software that makes a lot of choices from the start. Not all of those choices are going to be correct, but there’s nearly always a way to change the defaults. Moreover, all other things being equal, I’m on the \u003Ca href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eside of DHH\u003C/a\u003E on preferring to code in Ruby over Javascript.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDrawbacks to Rails\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tRails is getting faster and more powerful all the time, but it’s start up time is still quite slow. Its response time would benefit greatly if it used an asynchronous, event driven architecture, but that would require rewriting the entire framework and all its libraries–never a good idea. You’d lose all the synchronous advantages like simplicity of code, no need for callbacks, sequential execution, and ease of debugging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFaye to the Rescue\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSo how can we have our cake and eat it? \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://faye.jcoglan.com/\"\u003EFaye\u003C/a\u003E uses the powerful \u003Ca href=\"http://rubyeventmachine.com/\"\u003EEventMachine library\u003C/a\u003E to bring event processing to Ruby. It wasn’t hard to integrate with Ruby, especially thanks to Ryan Bates’ handy \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/ryanb/private_pub/\"\u003EPrivatePub\u003C/a\u003E (\u003Ca href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/316-private-pub\"\u003ERailscast\u003C/a\u003E). So now we have both synchronous and asynchronous I/O living in the same app. How does this help? Forms and views can be written in the standard Rails way and server push notifications can be sent out at any time. Client events can trigger Rails actions that notify other clients of the changes à la \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Flotype/now\"\u003ENowJS\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EOther Options\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOther than Rails and Node, there are a few notable frameworks in other languages. Erlang is a good language choice because of its concurrency and making asynchronous development easier. \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.chicagoboss.org/\"\u003EChicago Boss\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://nitrogenproject.com/\"\u003ENitrogen\u003C/a\u003E both look like promising frameworks written in Erlang. Haskel enforces strict typing and automatically executes in a non-blocking manner and boasts the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.yesodweb.com/\"\u003EYesod\u003C/a\u003E web framework. Choosing these or other less mainstream languages may or may not pan out well depending on your organization’s willingness to try new things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThe Future\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSo what will the next generation of web frameworks be like? I don’t see a clear winner here. Rails is excellent at building RESTful services and Node works great for client-heavy web apps. Rails’ features will gradually get ported over to Node through packages such as Express and Railway. Node will influence Rails developers to consider event-driven architecture where they need it, such as push notifications and multi-user collaboration. Other languages will exert their influence and perhaps produce formidable challengers to Rails and Node. From a user’s perspective a non-blocking asynchronous application seems faster as the UI can continue to accept input even while performing tasks on the server. So I do hope to see more emphasis in the Rails community on event-driven I/O.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

Initially overwhelmed, I wrote it off as another set of syntax to learn with no real benefits. What’s the point right? I’ll know if my code doesn’t work because, well...it won’t work.  I was required to use TDD in the beginning of my training and the more I used it, the more I understood and appreciated the benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaintaining focus.  You have a problem, you start to solve it, and before you know it you’re working on a totally different issue.  How do you know what you want to happen or when the problem is solved?  What do you want out of the code?  The tests will tell you!  These questions are the first ones you answer while writing your tests.  It forces you to plan first then write the code to make it do what you want later.  Baby steps is the name of the game when incrementally building solid code functionality. Write the tests that fail, do the simplest thing that works, and then move on to the next.  Programming this way really lets you focus on the creative part of the problem solving rather than getting caught up in trying to remember what you were doing.  TDD works as an outline to keep you focused and in your flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tddmeme.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4749\" alt=\"TDD meme\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tddmeme.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe consumer of the software we build matters, right?  When you write tests you write them around exactly how the consumer will use the software, what you want them to experience, and what you want to happen.  The first thing you have to do is think about each step the consumer will take.  If you write strong tests, your code will be more solid, concise, and do what you want it to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe greatest gift TDD ever gave me was a deeper understanding of the \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\"\u003EMVC pattern\u003C/a\u003E, which was a difficult concept for me to grasp as a new programmer; especially figuring out how they all work together and what each one is in charge of, I’m still learning!  It’s all part of the RED, GREEN, REFACTOR mantra.  When you write tests, you write them so that they will fail.  That failure will give you an error with clues about where in the program the problem is taking place.  Is it telling you it can’t find the ‘Submit’ button? Well then you know you probably want to check the view to see if you have it there.  It gives you a starting point to solve the problem, an immensely beneficial aspect when trying to fix a broken program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew to TDD?

This is called a probabilistic algorithm. Unlike the deterministic approach (where we ask everyone), this algorithm may return different results based on who we ask (and in what order we ask them). This is how your brain works. It turns perceptions (inputs) into experiences (outputs), where past experiences affect current perception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThis human-based, human-inspired, discrete probabilistic approach is the most accurate and efficient way to solve a consensus task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn a consensus task, the goal is to identify a hidden state of the world by collecting multiple assessments from human workers. (In our example, whether the haircut is good or bad.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn order to solve consensus tasks eﬀectively, the decision making system needs to trade oﬀ the benefit of asking someone new with its immediate cost (in our example, the time and efforts spent asking).

By the end of it’s first year, more than 50 million classifications were received, contributed by more than 150,000 people. That means that each galaxy was seen by ~50 participants.

Well, that wasn't sending anything back to the Rails API. Every time I reloaded the browser, my beers were back in their original order. Let’s fix that.\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/controllers/ballot.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\r\n  sortProperties: ['weight'],\r\n\r\n  actions: {\r\n    swap: function(line_item_id_1, line_item_id_2) {\r\n      var li1, li1_weight, li2, li2_weight;\r\n      li1 = this.model.get('line_items').findBy('id', line_item_id_1);\r\n      li2 = this.model.get('line_items').findBy('id', line_item_id_2);\r\n      li1_weight = li1.get('weight');\r\n      li2_weight = li2.get('weight');\r\n      li1.set('weight', li2_weight);\r\n      li2.set('weight', li1_weight);\r\n      return Ember.$.ajax({\r\n        url: \"/api/v1/ballots/\" + (this.model.get('id')) + \"/swap/\" + (li1.get('id')) + \"/\" + (li2.get('id')),\r\n        type: 'put'\r\n      }).done(function() {}).fail(function() {\r\n        li1.rollback();\r\n        return li2.rollback();\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the addition of the AJAX call at the end of the `swap` action in the ballot controller. There is likely a cleaner and more Ember(y) way to do this, and I would love to hear it in the comments below; however, that call got the job done for me and it's good enough to finish out this drag and drop prototype. I opened my console and was pleased to see an AJAX PUT network request after a drop event. Let’s set up our Rails API endpoint.\r\n\r\n###The Coupling\r\n\r\nIn my head, I know I want the interaction between my Ember and Rails apps to look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ----------------                                      -------------------\r\n|                |   PUT: /api/v1/ballots/1/swap/1/2  |                   |\r\n| Ember Frontend |   ==============================\u003E  | Rails API Backend |\r\n|                |                                    |                   |\r\n ----------------                                      -------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is *really* all we need. A single endpoint that says \"swap the weight of line item 1 and line item 2 on ballot 1.\" That way, we keep the data on our backend API in sync with that is going on in the Ember frontend.\r\n\r\nSo, let’s do a little Rails to get this all set up. We are going to generate a ballot controller, then update the routes to access the request to `/api/v1/ballots/:id/swap/:li1_id/:li2_id`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails g controller Api::V1::Ballots\r\n```\r\n\r\n**config/routes.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nnamespace :api do\r\n  namespace :v1 do\r\n    resources :ballots do\r\n      put '/swap/:li1/:li2', to: 'ballots#swap'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen make yourself a controller action for swap.\r\n\r\n**app/controllers/ballots_controller.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Api::V1::BallotsController \u003C ApplicationController\r\n  respond_to :json\r\n\r\n  def swap\r\n    ballot = Ballot.find(params[:ballot_id])\r\n    ballot.swap(LineItem.find(params[:li1]), LineItem.find(params[:li2]))\r\n    if ballot.save\r\n      render json: {}\r\n    else\r\n      render status: 500\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, I added this method to my `Ballot` model to handle swapping line items.\r\n\r\n**app/models/ballots.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef swap(li1, li2)\r\n  li1_weight = li1.weight\r\n  li2_weight = li2.weight\r\n  li1.weight = li2_weight\r\n  li2.weight = li1_weight\r\n  li1.save \u0026\u0026 li2.save\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that should work well. Right?\r\n\r\n###Dealing with Rails CSRF\r\n\r\nThat AJAX PUT **should** have worked but our Rails API is throwing back a crazy error.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is going on now is that Rails is kicking back our request due to a missing CSRF token. Luckily, there is a CSRF ember npm package we can install that will handle setting the token in all our request headers.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install --save rails-csrf\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is done running, update your `app.js` to include your new module and your `routes/index.js` to request the rails CSRF token before page load:\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/app.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\nimport Resolver from 'ember/resolver';\r\nimport loadInitializers from 'ember/load-initializers';\r\nimport config from './config/environment';\r\n\r\nEmber.MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS = true;\r\n\r\nvar App = Ember.Application.extend({\r\n  modulePrefix: config.modulePrefix,\r\n  podModulePrefix: config.podModulePrefix,\r\n  Resolver: Resolver\r\n});\r\n\r\nloadInitializers(App, config.modulePrefix);\r\n\r\n//Initialize Rails CSRF\r\nloadInitializers(App, 'rails-csrf');\r\nimport { setCsrfUrl } from 'rails-csrf/config';\r\nsetCsrfUrl('api/v1/csrf');\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/routes/index.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.Route.extend({\r\n  controllerName: 'ballot',\r\n\r\n  beforeModel: function() {\r\n    return this.csrf.fetchToken();\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  model: function() {\r\n    return this.store.find('ballot', 1);\r\n  },\r\n  setupController: function(controller, model){\r\n    controller.set('model', model);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the addition of \"beforeModel.\" This will request the csrf token from the backend before every page load, but we are not done yet. We need to support this request to `/api/v1/csrf` in our Rails application.\r\n\r\nFirst, we add this line to our routes.rb file underneath the `:api` and `:v1` namespace declarations.\r\n\r\n**routes.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nget :csrf, to: 'csrf#index'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we will generate a simple CSRF controller to handle this request.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails g controller Api::V1::Csrf index\r\n```\r\n\r\n**csrf_controller.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Api::V1::CsrfController \u003C ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    render json: { request_forgery_protection_token =\u003E form_authenticity_token }.to_json\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is complete. Restart your `rails server` then reload your Ember app. Now start dragging and dropping to modify your beer rankings. You should see that, on every drop event, an AJAX request is being sent back to the Rails application and updating the line items weights. Now, when you refresh your browser, your updates to beer rankings will be persisted!\r\n\r\n##Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile it does take a *little* work to wire up a Rails/Ember application, they play quite well together!

Rivaled only by HTML5 in terms of buzzword status and pedestal placement, our mysterious stranger tore down most of the walls that \r\n\t\u003Ccode\u003Ewidth: 960px;\u003C/code\u003E built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn the resulting excitement, some developers hailed RWD as the saviour of us all, while others tried it and swore it off as a time-sink. Still others are waiting for RWD to blow over so we can get back to making websites.\u0026nbsp;Additionally, device makers are coming to the same realization as everyone else \u0026mdash; we are no longer constrained to an area the size of a sheet of paper. Amidst all the fuss, I noticed plenty of confusion about it at all levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhat Responsive Is.\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tRWD is the idea and methodology behind creating websites that respond to the user’s environment and behaviors. Screen size, device orientation, and resolution all factor into how the content is displayed to the user. The use of media queries, fluid grids, and flexible media all work together to provide an optimal viewing experience. Rather than multiple codebases for each target screen size, a single codebase serves all users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tMany have \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/responsive-web-design-guidelines-tutorials/#a2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Edefined\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-web-design-missing-the-point/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Erefined\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.quora.com/Responsive-Web-Design/What-is-responsive-design\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eenhanced\u003C/a\u003E responsive’s basic definition, but the following is all we really need to understand the approach. Media queries, fluid grids, and flexible media aren’t just the trappings of a responsive website, they are the core techniques of the practice. Media queries allow the application of different CSS depending on screen dimensions and orientation. Fluid grids structure the site design around ratios rather than fixed values (i.e. 960px) and allow sites to conform to different screen sizes. Media assets adapt to device sizes allowing users a more complete experience regardless of how they access the site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAnyone who built websites over the past year likely heard the above terms on a daily basis. However, responsive web design hasn’t been the topic\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003E\u0026nbsp;du jour\u003C/em\u003E for all that long. To help illustrate the recency of the responsive web conversation, I’ve included Google Trends data on related terms below (embedded):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe data doesn’t exactly represent any peer-reviewed research, but you can get a feel for how long the terms have been relevant. Around May 2010 queries for RWD and its constituent terms really start to lift. Ethan Marcotte published “\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\"\u003EResponsive Web Design\u003C/a\u003E” on \u003Cem\u003EA List Apart\u003C/em\u003E around the same time, drawing parallels to the architectural concept of the same name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhat’s the point here? I can’t think of the last project I worked on where a responsive website wasn’t at least considered, if not actually included and launched. As a developer, responsive design is part of my day-to-day considerations, but the concept has only met wide discussion in the last few years and applied on a large scale for even less time. Yes, the Web moves fast but this isn’t just a new coding technique or browser feature \u0026mdash; what\u0026nbsp;we’re looking at\u0026nbsp;is a fundamental shift in paradigms. An object’s width is one of its most basic properties, and the width of the Web is changing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhat Responsive Isn’t.\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWith so many benefits to having a site that can dress for any occasion, why not just make that the norm and usher in a new, device-agnostic era on the Web? As an overly excited web developer, that was certainly my first impulse. However, responsive design isn’t “the solution” and depending on your situation it may not address any of your major problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt really doesn’t matter what numbers you \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406331,00.asp\"\u003Elook\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/insights/library/infographics/mobile-movement/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eat\u003C/a\u003E, mobile web use is up. Way up. All the way up. And traffic is only \u003Ca href=\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-520862.html\"\u003Eslated to increase\u003C/a\u003E. When the majority of users were on desktop browsers we could set a page’s width to the narrowest of the target screen resolutions and be pretty safe. Now, a user might access your site not only on a smartphone, but from several different non-desktop devices \u003Ca href=\"http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/multi-screen_infographic.pdf\"\u003Ein the course of completing a single task\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tUsers’ changing usage patterns will impact any Web-bound project you start, therefore it’s increasingly important to analyze your target audience before deciding on what approach to take. If your site analytics show that most visits come from IE8 workstations, no level of responsiveness will improve those users’ experience. By the same token, if your primary demographic turns out to be tablet and mobile users, just adding a few media queries can vastly improve how your site renders on those devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe key takeaway is that responsive design is a technique. It’s not a framework, or a toolkit, or a plugin or anything else but a method of problem solving. Similar to all problem-solving techniques, responsive isn’t suited for every problem. There are cases where having a separate mobile and desktop site is quicker, cheaper, or more effective than a responsive site that caters to every device. Smashing Magazine published an \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/22/separate-mobile-responsive-website-presidential-smackdown/\"\u003Ein-depth comparison\u003C/a\u003E of 2012′s presidential candidates’ mobile approaches (one responsive, one with a separate mobile site) to solving the same problem,\u0026nbsp;that helps to underline the challenges inherent in both techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhere to now?\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tRWD is arguably the most popular of several attempts to cope with and adapt to a changing problem space. Just think, if painters were only ever shown an 8.5×11-inch canvas, then suddenly given a nearly infinite number of width and height combinations to work with, they too would need to take stock. They would likely need to reexamine everything they thought they knew about composition. Perhaps they would develop techniques for dealing with especially large or small canvases. Whatever the outcome, once the painters learned to deal with the new variable in their workflow, they would return to task: painting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe metaphor may be a little shaky since paintings usually don’t have to “respond” to different canvas sizes, but I think the point stands. Every time the problem space changes, those who work within that space adapt their methods and continue producing. The need for responsive websites will not go away, but building a “responsive website” instead of just a website is the same as building an “good SEO website” or an “HTML5 website”. All these things are merely attributes, they are not the site itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIf web design is problem solving, every website is a solution to a specific problem. How effectively a particular site solves the problem has nothing to do with which framework or how many media queries it uses. Instead, a site’s effectiveness relies on how carefully its developer chooses its constituent components and how well those components work together to address the original problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

The vehicles were, of course, striking, but the part of the exhibit that most resonated with me were the accompanying photographs of engineers, factory workers, and the Porsche family, themselves. It’s interesting how we glorify beautiful objects, while somehow forgetting that flesh and blood human beings actually conceived of, designed, and built the objects. Their humanity and vision drove their craft and set their creations apart. Just as important to me were the people to whom these cars belonged. Again, these were real, live people with a passion (sometimes an obsession) for a particular feeling that only a Porsche could give them. I, personally, am a \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mopar\"\u003EMopar\u003C/a\u003E man, but those cars weren’t built for me. They weren’t built for my grandma and they weren’t built based on a persona created by a research department. They were built for Porsche drivers, a market that didn’t exist until the first Porsches started rolling out of the workshop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tSo why did that move me? Why is it important at all? It’s simple – if a group of men created enduring beauty that speaks to something in the hearts of other men, then so could I. That’s maybe the most trite, cliche thing I’ve ever written, but it’s a desire that I’ve felt is sometimes lacking in the user experience field. There’s a tendency to design based solely on convention, frameworks, and the insights of a select few “thought leaders”. That’s a great way to deliver something that won’t fail, but should avoiding failure be your goal as a UX professional? Or should it be to innovate and inspire wherever possible? Should you make important decisions based on research that’s been abstracted and extrapolated to the point of losing all basis in reality, or should you rely on your instinct, your gut? I know that there’s a place for plug-n-chug, and I’m not one to reinvent the wheel, but it’s incumbent on us to take every opportunity to inject our humanity into the products that we build. If your average UX team is comfortable building Honda Civics for a wide swath of people to be completely stupefied by, that’s great. There’s a place for that.

Frame and body design, headlight housing, interior cabins, exhaust systems, paint jobs, etc., varied greatly between models, but you always knew you were looking at a Porsche. It seemed each design achieved a high level of style and character primarily through the exceptional care taken to exceed functional requirements. By artfully meeting functional needs and working with strong overall design foundations of the Porsche brand, designers were able to go in bold new directions. The evolution of design within the Porsche line seemed to serve as a foundation for the transition to new and innovative designs. In the following \u003Ca href=\"http://vimeo.com/78937043\"\u003Evideo\u003C/a\u003E, Daniel Weil does a great job of articulating\u0026nbsp;the thought process that\u0026nbsp;designers go through as a product design is developed and refined over time. Although the product is extremely different (in Weil’s case it is a baby bottle), the overall care taken to address functional requirements is not unlike Porsche design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDoug (Design)\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tThe thing that stuck out to me the most when our team visited the NC Art Museum’s Porsche By Design exhibit was the elegant simplicity of some of the earlier models of Porsches. The colors were classic, the curves were refined, the details were subtle, and the racing liveries were bold. In my opinion, the older models felt like they were a lot more in line with the designers’ initial visions even keeping in mind the fact that times have changed, technology has changed, and that design trends have come and gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tI think it was Da Vinci who said, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Porsche has always created amazing cars, but those earlier models were really amazing. Stripped of, or altogether void of, the amenities and nice-to-haves that are commonplace on today’s cars (I don’t think I saw a single cup holder in the exhibit). They had a unified and balanced feel to them. Getting to see all of these cars was really inspirational and it got me thinking about the work that I do. It seems all too common today to jam-pack cars, web pages, logos, songs, you name it, with far too much unnecessary\u0026hellip;stuff. So whether we’re talking about features, content, colors, elements, or shiny distractions, the most memorable solutions are often the most simple. /rant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tAll in all though, this exhibit was awesome.

When I say “designed,” I am not referencing just the outer body of the car, which is by the way, very pleasing to the eye. I am talking about the overall car itself.

Similarly, the app is not well designed if it has optimal performance, but is not appealing to the eye.

The Ember community has been exploding with\r\nawesome new tools to make developing and testing your Ember applications easier than ever. I am a Rails developer and when I first\r\nstarted working with Ember, the fastest way for me to get up and running was to use [ember-rails](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails)\r\nand seriously tweak my the asset pipeline. It wasn't all bad at first but as [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) started\r\nto become the de-facto standard for new Ember apps I felt myself getting left in the dust. Once I heard that ember-cli was going\r\nto become a first class citizen in Ember v2 I decided to quit dragging my feet and get on board with the new way to build Ember apps\r\n\r\n## The App\r\nWhat I needed to build was an application where users could rank their favorite beers via a drag-and-drop ordering UI. Here is what I came up\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/1D2Q1y191W1o0C3V200s/Screen%20Recording%202014-11-10%20at%2010.27%20AM.gif)\r\n\r\nWhile not 100% fleshed out from a UX point of view this interface was surprisingly simple to implement. In the past I would of had to\r\nwrite a mountain of javascript just to get all the AJAX calls right. THEN I would go out and find some JQuery plugin, become an expert in it\r\nand click around in my element inspector for hours until everything was just right.\r\n\r\nNot anymore, I only used the following combination of tools  \r\n\r\n* Rails  \r\n* ember-cli  \r\n* HTML5 drag-and-drop  \r\n\r\n## Rails API\r\nThe Rails API was crazy simple. I used [active_model_serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)\r\nand just a handfull of rails-generated models.\r\n\r\n**Generate a new rails app w/o sprockets**  \r\n```sh\r\n$ rails new App --skip-sprockets\r\n$ cd App\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update Gemfile**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\r\n\r\ngem 'rails', '4.1.6'\r\ngem 'sqlite3'\r\ngem 'active_model_serializers'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bundle Install**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not going to dive into the details of the API. If you want to see the models, routes, serializers, and controllers then\r\nyou can look at the [codebase here](https://github.com/smashingboxes/labs-AppTheKeg/tree/f8f152adee56569eb733e07ee344e8d8570b778d). If you have any\r\nquestions then please feel free to post them in the comments bellow. :)\r\n\r\nOnce you have your API built out, you should have the following 2 endpoints ready that your Ember app can talk to.\r\n```\r\nPUT    /api/v1/ballots/:ballot_id/swap/:li1/:li2(.:format)\r\nGET    /api/v1/ballots/:id(.:format)\r\n```\r\nAll we will be doing is getting a ballot and swapping the line_items on that ballot when we drag a beer over another beet.

This will\r\nallow you to use ES6 module syntax, sass, handlebars, coffeescript, and other transpiles languages that you like.\r\n\r\nNow, startup your Ember app.\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd EmberApp\r\n$ ember server\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see this output\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/0r1a1k1f1n31/Image%202014-11-10%20at%2011.27.07%20AM.png)\r\n\r\nAnd you will see the following @ `localhost:4200`\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/2g3G222w110Y/Image%202014-11-10%20at%2011.27.47%20AM.png)\r\n\r\nNow, we will start writing Ember. I like to setup my adapter and generate my models first. For this\r\nblog post we will be using [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data).\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ember generate adapter application\r\n$ ember generate model Ballot\r\n$ ember generate model LineItem\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate your generated `EmberApp/app/adapters/application.js`. We will need to update our adaptor namespace to `/api/v1`. Then we need to tell Ember to use the ActiveModelAdapter. Ember, out of the box, knows how to communicate with a Rails app using ActiveRecordSerializers. We will also tell it the namespace of our api.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\r\n\r\nexport default DS.ActiveModelAdapter.extend({\r\n  namespace: 'api/v1',\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow open the generated `EmberApp/app/models/line-item.js` model to find a lot of ember-cli generated javascript!\r\nWe used to have to do all this tedious work to wire up our models by hand, but now ember-cli handles\r\nall this for us. All we need to do is define the attributes for a line item.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\r\n\r\nexport default DS.Model.extend({\r\n  beer_name: DS.attr('string'),\r\n  weight: DS.attr('number'),\r\n  ballot: DS.belongsTo('ballot'),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBallot will be a little bit different. We are going to use a computed property called `sorted_line_items` to sort the ballot's line-items\r\nby weight. This will be important since we want to be able to re-arrange the sorted list of beers. Open\r\n`EmberApp/app/models/ballot.js` and update the js with the following.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\r\n\r\nexport default DS.Model.extend({\r\n  line_items: DS.hasMany('line_items'),\r\n\r\n  sorted_line_items: (function(){\r\n    return this.get('line_items').sortBy('weight');\r\n  }).property('line_items.@each.weight'),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, generate a ballot controller and a line-item view. These don't need to be modified yet.\r\n```sh\r\n$ ember generate controller Ballot\r\n$ ember generate view LineItem\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we will create an index route.\r\n```sh\r\n$ ember generate route index\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate an `EmberApp/app/routes/index.js` route file and `index.hbs` handlebars template. We'll now go into these\r\nfiles and define what controller and model we will want to use.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.Route.extend({\r\n  controllerName: 'ballot',\r\n\r\n  model: function() {\r\n    return this.store.find('ballot', 1);\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  setupController: function(controller, model){\r\n    controller.set('model', model);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we will define a simple view at `EmberApp/app/templates/index.hbs`.\r\n\r\n```handlebars\r\n\u003Cdiv class='container'\u003E\r\n  \u003Cdiv class='container'\u003E\r\n    \u003Col\u003E\r\n      {{#each controller.model.sorted_line_items}}\r\n        \u003Cli\u003E\r\n          {{beer_name}}\r\n        \u003C/li\u003E\r\n      {{/each}}\r\n    \u003C/ul\u003E\r\n  \u003C/div\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Rails\r\n\r\nThe Rails side of this application is pretty simple. A single controller, for getting ballots and a basic model structure that looks like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n --------            ----------           ------\r\n|        |  1  0..* |          |  1    1 |      |\r\n| Ballot | \u003C======= | LineItem | ======\u003E | Beer |\r\n|        |          |  weight  |         | name |\r\n --------            ----------           ------\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little `rails generate` *magic* should get us pretty far.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails g model Ballot\r\n$ rails g model Beer name:string\r\n$ rails g model LineItem ballot:references beer:references weight:integer\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I just made a tiny ballot in my seeds that we can use to play with for this app\r\n\r\n**db/seeds.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nBeer.delete_all\r\nBallot.delete_all\r\n\r\nb1 = Beer.create!(name: 'Goose Island IPA')\r\nb2 = Beer.create!(name: 'Dogfish Head 90 Min IPA')\r\nb3 = Beer.create!(name: 'Mother Earth Oatmeal Stout')\r\nb4 = Beer.create!(name: 'Raleigh Brewing Mocha Stout')\r\n\r\nBallot.create!(beers: [b1, b2, b3, b4], user_id: 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, I created a BallotsController and route so that my Ember app has a ballot that it can grab from the Rails app.\r\n\r\n**app/controllers/api/v1/ballots_controller.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Api::V1::BallotsController \u003C ApplicationController\r\n  respond_to :json\r\n\r\n  def show\r\n    render json: Ballot.first\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**app/serializers/ballot_serializer.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass BallotSerializer \u003C ActiveModel::Serializer\r\n  embed :ids, include: true\r\n  attributes :id\r\n  has_many :line_items, serializer: LineItemSerializer\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**config/routes.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  namespace :api do\r\n    namespace :v1 do\r\n      resources :ballots\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, initialize a Rails server...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails s\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and then initialize your Ember app via ember-cli but you will need to tell ember to talk to `localhost:3000` which *should* be where your rails app is hosted at.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce your ember server is up and running, point your browser to `localhost:4200` and you will see this. **Dont forget to seed your database!**\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/1e1D0m0J161V/Image%202014-12-03%20at%209.53.45%20AM.png)\r\n\r\n##Resources\r\n\r\n* [App Repo](https://github.com/smashingboxes/blog-mergin_rails_ember_cli)\r\n* [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n[In part two](http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli-part-2), I'll go into detail about how I implemented HTML5 drag-n-drop functionality for updating beer rankings.

Offering crash courses in high-demand software languages, code schools give non-developers an opportunity to secure a better job with their new programming skills. Typically three months in length, they combine teaching and mentorship with real world development work. “Successful schools center their curriculum around practical application” says Eric Dodds of \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://theironyard.com/academy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThe Iron Yard Academy\u003C/a\u003E , a nationally respected code academy based out of Greenville, S.C. “By the end, students emerge as professional, junior-level programmers.” Nauman and Miller are both graduates of a code school, and they’ve found their lives transformed by it.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tCode academies, when done right, are profoundly challenging. “The information I read about the code school described the academy as boot camp style and super intense,” recalls Nauman who attended \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.launchacademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELaunch Academy\u003C/a\u003E in Boston. “I completely underestimated what that meant.

I spent easily 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week in school or studying; basically eating, sleeping, and breathing code. It was much harder than I expected.”\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tMiller, who attended The Iron Yard Academy, agrees, “It was overwhelming at first.

In the past if you needed something you could open up a free support ticket. Now the only options for free support are the docs or \u003Ca title=\"Stack Overflow\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/heroku\"\u003EStack Overflow\u003C/a\u003E. Yes, they actually link to Stack Overflow on their \u003Ca title=\"Help page\" href=\"https://help.heroku.com/\"\u003Enew help page\u003C/a\u003E.

But AWS does have a free forum where Amazon employees reply to users’ support questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tI recently had an issue related to billing with Heroku. Heroku offered a beta period for their new database stack allowing developers to try out their new databases free of charge. I added a couple for testing believing they would remain free until their general release in August. Heroku’s\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca title=\"blog post\" href=\"https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/5/3/crane_the_new_50_per_month_production_database_/\"\u003Eblog post\u003C/a\u003E indicated they would notify users prior to billing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Selection_032.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1600\" title=\"Heroku July newsletter\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Selection_032-300x169.png\" alt=\"Heroku July newsletter\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tI assumed there would be an additional step needed to opt-in before being billed, but this was not the case. The only notice I found was a note in one of their email newsletters (which I never read). The notice was one sentence in the middle of the email (underlined in red).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tNearly two months later, I discovered we had accumulated several hundred dollars in charges for databases that we weren’t even using. I tried writing them back at their billing@heroku.com account, but it’s been three weeks and I have not received a response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EHow AWS would have prevented this\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAround the same time that I noticed the excessive Heroku charges, I logged into our AWS account. What a pleasant surprise to be greeted with a message telling me how to set up notifications for estimated cost triggers. (I already use Amazon’s \u003Ca title=\"SNS\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sns/\"\u003ESimple Notification Service\u003C/a\u003E for CPU usage alerts on our EC2 instances.) The alerts are easy to configure due to an intuitive web interface. After establishing a preferred trigger, you can review the past few days’ activity which shows when the trigger would have activated. I immediately set up cost alerts for my AWS account. AWS was nice enough to place the cost alert feature in a prominent place where everyone should see it. Heroku may have a similar feature, but I have not found it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe billing issue is a small concern, but it illustrates how mature AWS has become while Heroku’s new interface is somewhat of a regression. In the future I will explore how to get up and running on AWS, and how to leverage Ruby gems to achieve similar functionality to that offered by Heroku.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

Much of what we “touch” currently is just noise in the form of data. There are hundreds of devices that monitor everything from sleep to blood glucose. To make this data relevant, these devices must communicate with each other and provide a smarter interpretation of the data. And there is still much to be desired where battery life and wearable interfaces are concerned.

This could soon be a problem of the past. New technologies like watch-enabled heart rate monitors can measure one’s unique rhythm and convert it to a password.

The firm projects that the wearable tech market will hit $4.5 billion by the end of 2014, and reach $53.2 billion by 2019. This is great news for OEMs who are investing heavily in wearable tech initiatives. However, several things need to fall into place in order for this market opportunity to achieve its full potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli\u003EIncreased Battery Life\u003C/li\u003E\t\u003Cli\u003EImproved User Experience\u003C/li\u003E\t\u003Cli\u003EMaking Data Useful\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDeath By Discharge\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOne of the key issues challenging wearable device engagement at the six month mark is the inconvenience of having to charge it. According to LeBoeuf, industry statistics show that as soon as someone takes off the device there is a more than one third chance they won’t put it back on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t“When you have to take your device off to charge it, you immediately disengage the user and they begin to wonder how much value they are getting by counting steps.” This is what LeBoeuf calls “death by discharge.” “If their experience with the device is a good one, then they will likely put it back on but if not it may become best friends with the underwear drawer,” he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tDr. Berkoff agrees. “As an athlete, it’s one of my biggest frustrations...I’m ready to go on a long ride and I forgot to charge my device,” he said. He also sees battery life as a big barrier to getting regular joes to purchase the devices, “If it’s a problem for early adopters, then you know it’s going to be an issue for everyone else.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOrganizations like \u003Ca href=\"http://assist.ncsu.edu/\"\u003EAdvanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies(ASSIST)\u003C/a\u003E at North Carolina State University are working on solving the battery life issue. They are developing technologies to enable battery free and body powered devices. Tom Snyder, Industry Liaison for ASSIST explains, “we are utilizing nanotechnology to bring the energy requirement for sensors and wireless data transmission down to a level that your body can be utilized as a power supply.” As an example, ASSIST materials, embedded in a textile can harvest energy from the temperature difference between the skin and air, and use this to power the sensors. This not only has an impact on clothing but also on medical devices. They’re currently working on a battery free pacemaker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EHuman-Centered Design Will Be Key\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tMarrying a relevant user experience with the appropriate interface will be key. Sensors embedded in a shirt to free up space coupled with a watch interface that delivers the information from clothing is one example. Another example of providing a good user experience is embedding technology in devices that are familiar, like headphones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t“We started with headphones because our audience were athletes and weekend warriors,” said LeBoeuf. “They already wore headphones when they worked out so it made sense. Why make them work harder and purchase another device?”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAccording to an industry report by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/RockHealth/the-future-of-biosensing-wearables-by-rockhealth)\"\u003ERock Health\u003C/a\u003E, a health incubator and fund based in San Francisco, California, one of the biggest barriers to engagement is at the onset of using the device. Meaning, quite literally, the pain of getting it out of the box and setting it up. Reports indicate that close to 10 percent of technology products are returned before they are even used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFashion is also an important element in adoption; it’s about both form and function. Technology software and hardware designers are not accustomed to the nuances of fashion design. Consider the success of the smartphone, given it is typically stuffed in our pockets. If wearables are to succeed, brands must immerse themselves in fashion trends and psychology to inspire design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EGetting Personal\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn 2013, over 70 million wearable devices were sold and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2913318\"\u003Eby 2016 that number will reach over 90 million\u003C/a\u003E. With that said, the adoption rate will slow or decline if these devices don’t provide more meaning and context about how to improve our health, fitness, and life based upon our goals and needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tTo truly connect the data, simplifying the communication between devices through a universal API will become critically important. It will start when devices talk to each other. Thanks to your phone’s G.P.S., RFID, or Bluetooth, you’ll get a personalized workout plan the second you arrive at the gym and adjust the intensity based upon your previous workout, cortisol levels and hydration. The device will know that it took longer for you to fall into REM sleep because home sensors indicate that you kept the lights on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tA number of companies including Nike are already moving towards coach-enhanced apps that learn from your performance outputs and adjusts your next workout accordingly. Apple’s new health and fitness app will tell you when you need to stand or move more (two keys to cardiovascular health) based upon real time information from their Watch. In addition to Apple and Nike, a number of other companies are hiring teams of exercise physiologists, data scientists, and physicians to help move data from descriptive to prescriptive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tDr. Berkoff agrees that for devices to be adopted by the mainstream they have to provide more than just entertaining data to the user. “Physicians and their patients need to understand how they are progressing and if there is the need for an intervention,” he said. “Data is just data without proper interpretation and there may be times where the physicians don’t have time during a clinic visit to interpret the data. We just need to know when to connect with the patient.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tDr. Berkoff says that sports medicine physicians, physical therapists and other healthcare professionals can benefit from the continuous monitoring and interpretation of movement. “I can only get so much information in a 10-15 minute office visit,” he explained. “I may watch someone walk or run during that visit, but they may be on their best behavior giving me less than perfect data. To really understand how they move and to make the best prescription we would benefit from continuous monitoring and feedback which we could then use to provide the patient with a better plan on how to progress and improve.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EThe Future Is Already Here...Sort Of\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tCompanies and startups are already creating new ways to measure health and performance and help people be more productive.

Feedback can take many forms, but in our world it comes as a result of getting apps into users’ hands. Project stakeholders, fellow employees, and even customers are part of the feedback ecosystem. They are all capable of giving quality, measurable feedback on an application during its design and development. Feedback allows our team and clients insight into our products that are otherwise unavailable when a project is merely a concept. Armed with insights, the path to deploying a successful application becomes clearer and the client’s investment generates a higher return. Both are possible because the development teams work on what matters most to the project. The result is delivering end users the features that matter most to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Print.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2036\" title=\"The Ideal Feedback Loop\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Print.jpg\" alt=\"Fisch's sketch of the ideal feedback loop\" width=\"371\" height=\"210\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf feedback loops are so great, then why the antagonism? Typically the answer is budget. Most often startups, non-profits, and Fortune 1000s source their products to us because they don’t have the internal expertise or bandwidth to compete the project. Our clients don’t just want hours of development time, they want a finished product which serves the needs of their organization. Usually, project funding is dependent on deliverables that funding will obtain. While our project leaders and stakeholders understand that dollars equal deliverables, the powers behind the purse strings sometimes do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue at hand is not that feedback will destroy a budget. Rather, it is that feedback whether positive or negative may shift the deliverables given the constraints of time and budget. The shift in deliverables is where our clients run into problems with their financiers. Of course feedback does not only impact our clients. Certain types of feedback may slow our development process or disrupt our project calendar. Any source of unpredictability for our weekly or bi-monthly sprints is not exactly desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest solution as a dev shop is to discourage feedback from an audience outside of our team and our client’s project team. That way, we deliver clean, tested code which meets every requirement defined during our discovery and planning phases. We fulfill the timeline and budget objectives, and can sleep easy knowing the client is satisfied. In the above case, the client and SB simply hope end users will be equally thrilled with how we executed the project. However, our best work is not produced in a vacuum. Rather, SB creates software using a combination of inputs: our insight as development and design experts; our client’s recommendations as SMEs on their product, organization, and business goals; and end users’ suggestions as experts in how they want to use mobile and web devices, and what they want to use them to accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Smashing Boxes we circumvent any feedback related issues through communication and planning. We negotiate willfully for the flexibility to obtain feedback and implement changes as identified by various stakeholders. While introducing a feedback loop to a project seemingly adds time and cost, it’s a necessary step for iterative development.

We had the opportunity to talk about our journeys, ups and downs, lessons learned, and more. A common question that arises in any discussion about entrepreneurship in general, is “what does it take to be an entrepreneur”? I have answered this question many times over, as had my fellow panelists, and I realized there was a common thread, which I have named the Four P’s of entrepreneurship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPassion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to love what you are doing. It’s not a decision based on metrics such as risk / reward. It’s not a job. It’s your life. You have to be so passionate about your startup or small business that it oozes out of you and makes people want to work with you and for you. Passion is what gives you the drive and motivation to see through the bumps in the road to the higher goal, helping you continue working toward that goal, even when it seems hopeless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tTobias Rose, of \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.komplekscreative.com\"\u003EKomplex Creative\u003C/a\u003E, really dove deep into this P, noting that passion is also how you differentiate yourself, through your passion for the work you are producing. They are a company similar to ours, and it’s great to hear that we share the same values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPersistence\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E– As a startup, people will NOT be knocking down your door to hand you money for your product or service, or invest in your startup. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.shoeboxed.com\"\u003ETobi Walters\u003C/a\u003E at Shoeboxed discussed the fact that he had no fewer than 70 meetings pitching investors to raise financing. What if he stopped at 69? He, like all entrepreneurs, had a goal or a task, and “no” was not an option. In my situation, I get “NO” all of the time. We do not win every project that we pursue, and I cannot let that get me down, or get in the way of ultimate dream I am pursuing. Keep following up, keep showing up, keep fighting…whether it’s for a coffee meeting with a potential mentor, raising money, or winning business, it’s hard, so be ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPerseverance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile persistence, in my opinion, has a more tactical and operational implication (don’t take “no” for an answer), perseverance speaks to the emotional strength that is needed to be an entrepreneur. Think about having no money in the bank and two weeks until the next set of bills are due (be it payroll if you have staff, or personal bills like rent, car payment). You can persist through yeses and noes and not let it impact your being, but when you’re faced with pending doom around every corner, that’s a much deeper issue. As an entrepreneur, your “business” issues – such as a customer going out of business and not paying an invoice, or an investor deciding to pass on your startup — are also personal issues — you are broke, you can’t make payroll, you can’t pay rent,  you’re a failure. Weathering these storms takes a strong character, a vision for the future, and the passion and persistence to see it through regardless of the ups and downs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPreparation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three ways to look at preparation: personal planning, business planning, and working hard. I don’t focus much on business plans, because I think they’re a waste of time. On the personal front, be prepared emotionally and financially. This will cost more than you think, and it will take longer than you think to make money. The typical rule of thumb is that “it” (your project, your startup, etc..) will take twice as long and cost 3 times as much. That is common knowledge among entrepreneurs, and was reaffirmed by my fellow panelist Jay Bigelow of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.cednc.org\"\u003ECEDNC\u003C/a\u003E, who’s been there and done that several times over. While it’s oversimplified, do your best to not be cutting it so close that you can’t adjust when that does inevitably arise. Working hard is the other form of preparation that is key to entrepreneurial success. You have passion, you persist, and you persevere. When you let nothing get in your way of success, and you continue to build, sell, improve, innovate, and press forward, you are preparing yourself for success. When you read a success story on \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com\"\u003ETechCrunch\u003C/a\u003E, or hear about the person who was on the brink of bankruptcy only to land their biggest account and turn it all around, remember that they were working hard the entire time and this is the result that they were preparing themselves for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tIn closing, I hope this message reaches all aspiring entrepreneurs. My goal is to give some baseline context for what it takes to be successful.

I was able to pick out the small pieces of lead, place them reversed on a slab of metal, then roll some paper over inked type and make a print. That was pretty cool. Then I learned how to set type in InDesign – using proper grids, baselines, columns and such – and create a well-set book. I felt like I was rockin’ it. With all this control in other mediums, the web was frustrating. I couldn’t set anything easily without a sort of workaround. I had to find a typeface on another service, take screenshots, and put them all together, just to see how something paired. I was one of the lucky ones to get a [requested] invitation to dive into Typecast and get my hands dirty.

Dr. Braunstein explains how data logistics impacts the health care system…\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tBig Data/Big Cloud\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tTo manage healthcare beyond the one doctor/one patient scenario, digital records are required. I noticed about three years ago that my primary care physician seemed to apologize a lot for not spending as much time “looking me in the eye” as he wanted to. Instead, he spent more time looking at his screen to be sure he was capturing the data appropriately. He was frustrated by it but knew it was important. Today’s health care ecosystem requires that your data be shared among many entities: specialists, insurance companies, hospitals, rehab centers, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBig Data certainly is impacting the current state of Healthcare IT (HIT).  While many definitions have arisen, at its essence big data is the term for the collection, storage and analysis of data sets so large and complex that processing the information requires advanced computing power and systems. This data is indeed being gathered, and it allows for new technologies to be developed that continually improve the industry. Indeed, it is spurring new entrepreneurial opportunities throughout all industries that touch the medical field – including government.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt could well be that it is a combination of “the cloud” and advent of big data analysis that has established the opportunity for the success of Healthcare IT. Dr. Braunstein suggested that, in IT, we make more of the Cloud than need be. Yet, it is the very fact that we can move data to the cloud and access it anywhere that opens up so many opportunities for healthcare IT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tCertainly the ability to access highly intimate and personal information on everyone in America has put some ill-at-ease. Data security becomes more critical than ever – and yet, we cannot possibly go back. There are \u003Ca href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/\"\u003EHIPAA regulations\u003C/a\u003E to help address these concerns, but new and better security systems and applications are yet another opportunity for healthcare IT innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tFinancing and the Affordable Care Act\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIf there is one industry in our country that needs reformation, healthcare is it. Other industries invested heavily in, and benefitted from, the streamlining of operations when they began utilizing IT for a more efficient and effective workplace. With the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/\"\u003EAffordable Care Act\u003C/a\u003E applying regular pressure to the systems behind the care, new technologies and strategies are being developed and deployed that ostensibly make it easier for consumers to control their own healthcare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAccording to Braunstein, healthcare in America remains a trailing edge industry. We’ve been bypassed by numerous nations throughout Europe, and many African countries have found ways to take better advantage of technology than we have… not only for tracking information and insurance, but for providing pharmaceutical data and apps that help with preventative care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tNot surprisingly, the reasons for this can be traced back to money. The reduction in healthcare spending, Dr. Braunstein points out, has fallen below inflation for the first time in U.S. history. In November, 2013, the White House published a paper entitled \u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/healthcostreport_final_noembargo_v2.pdf\"\u003ETrends in Health Care Cost Growth and the Role of the Affordable Care Act\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/em\u003Ein which it made these key points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHealth care spending growth is the lowest on record.

Quartz 2D is also known as Core Graphics (CG). When drawing custom views, CG offers a myriad of options. CG provides path based drawing, color management, off-screen rendering, and anti-aliased rendering. Additionally, it contains PDF options for PDF creation, PDF displaying and PDF parsing (reading the byte code in the PDF file stream).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne note of caution is to always remember to override\u0026nbsp;the drawRect method when drawing in your custom view. Use the drawRect method to write your code to draw, but never call the drawRect method in your\u0026nbsp;code. Instead, call the setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsDisplayInRect\u0026nbsp;method to notify the system that your view requires redrawing. Then the system can queue your setNeedsDisplay calls and automatically sweep through. During the sweep the system scans the view hierarchy and redraws views based on those who called setNeedsDisplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the most basic level CG allows you to draw paths, patterns, shadows and\u0026nbsp;gradients into contexts. There are several different contexts: PDF, Bitmap, Printing, and Window Graphics. While the PDF context generates PDF documents, the\u0026nbsp;Bitmap context generates jpg and png images. The printing context is for, you guessed it, drawing something to be printed. Finally, the Window Graphics context helps with tasks like free-hand drawing or building paths to create shapes for on-screen viewing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy utilizing Core Graphics in your next application you can improve UX and increase display speed of custom views on your iOS device.

You could end up exerting a lot of effort only to eventually run into a brick wall. Personally, I’ve had to \u003Ca title=\"Github issue\" href=\"https://github.com/customink/central_logger/pull/11\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehack gems\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca title=\"Ruby debug on Heroku\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6430419/run-ruby-debug-on-heroku\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Etry\u003C/a\u003E to find \u003Ca title=\"SO question\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6417475/rails-how-can-i-use-system-zip-on-heroku-to-make-a-docx-from-an-xml-template\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eworkarounds\u003C/a\u003E for many Heroku-specific issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nOn the other hand, if you know your application will fit within the limitations, deployment on Heroku is a breeze. The web interface is beautiful, the CLI client works well for the most part (except it can’t manage multiple Heroku accounts), and it’s easy to add other services through add-ons. But if you think your app’s needs might grow in ways that won’t be satisfied by simple horizontal scaling, you should definitely consider AWS. Of course, you can always start with Heroku and later migrate to AWS, but in that case you will have to configure your app for two environments and spend the time to migrate everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EOther options?\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn my experience, there are simply no other platforms that compare well with Heroku or AWS. There are some nice Heroku alternatives such as Dotcloud, but they suffer from coming after Heroku and thus having less integration with third-party products and less community support. Rackspace is the closest competitor to AWS, but it lacks the rich APIs and support that Amazon provides. Hopefully, we’ll see competitors catching up to Heroku and AWS and offering us more choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBoth Heroku and AWS are excellent platforms. They are quite different in some key areas. Understanding what each offers is essential to picking the right platform for your application. There is no clear winner here. Personally I like to use both. But my (simplified) mental test for which one to use is this: small app–Heroku; large app–Amazon. The winning platform is whichever one most helps you achieve your goals through keeping your developers happy and productive while remaining affordable enough to be sustainable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003EEditors note: Reed recently \u003Ca href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/heroku-vs-aws-revisited/\"\u003Erevisited\u003C/a\u003E the Heroku vs. AWS comparison.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

The applications that will be controlled are those that are classified as devices in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and are designed to: 1) convert mobile devices into medical devices that fall under FDA regulations or 2) be used as additional components to medical devices which fall under FDA regulations. The FDA states that only apps and devices that may risk a patient’s safety when nonfunctional are considered MMAs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are some examples of apps that will be regulated?\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tApps that use built-in features of phones or make use of additional sensors/attachments to perform medical tasks that are typically performed by health care practitioners to treat and diagnose diseases will be regulated. These include apps that measure heart activity, amplify heart sounds, and measure blood glucose levels. Additionally, apps that are used to control implantable or worn medical devices such as to change the setting of infusion pumps, act as wireless remote controls for imaging machines, and to calibrate cochlear implants fall under the regulations. Visit the guidance document linked above for a more complete list of examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat if my app is already on the market?\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSince most existing health apps do not fall under the FDA’s regulation guidelines, it is likely that if your app is already in app stores, you do not have to do anything and your app can remain on the market without extra review.

It’s fairly easy to use. So for a couple of active projects, our developers decided to exclusively use GitHub issues to track to-do items. We would gather our tasks based on a requirements document in Google Drive and add them as issues within GitHub. We would assign ourselves to the issue if it was something we were currently working on or something we could do quicker than anyone else. And when we pushed a commit, we could close the issue from the commit message.

In terms of curriculum, some programs focus intensely on\r\nlearning a specific language or highly related set of languages while other\r\nprograms provide a general, less focused, overview of many technologies.\r\nNeither is wrong or right, it simply depends on your goal. If you are hoping to\r\nleave the class with a job as a professional programmer, than you should look\r\ninto the first option. Alternatively, courses touching on numerous languages\r\nprovide an excellent technical foundation for people in non-programming roles\r\nin a technical environment, such as sales, marketing, technical writing, or\r\noperations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThere is perhaps greater disparity in\r\ngraduate satisfaction between \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://blog.theironyard.com/post/92054222278/no-night-classes\"\u003Epart-time and full-time programs\u003C/a\u003E.\r\nPart time programs allow for students to continue their everyday life while\r\ngetting a code school education. Students divide their time between their\r\nweekday job and code school, which is on evenings and/or weekends. This type of\r\nstudy allows for flexibility, but not for complete and undivided immersion into\r\nthe subject matter. Students of part time programs should be realistic about\r\nwhether this type of program will set them up for success as a professional\r\nprogrammer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFull time programs, on the other hand, mean\r\nthat the program essentially becomes a student’s day job, and then some. These\r\nprograms allow for the curriculum to be intensive and fully immersive because\r\nstudents won’t have outside distractions or side projects demanding their\r\nconcentration and time in addition to schoolwork. Students of full-time\r\nprograms tend to have a much more positive experience – both in securing a job\r\nand possessing the abilities to do the job – post code school.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBefore making the (often life changing)\r\ndecision to attend a code school, ask yourself the following questions to help\r\ndetermine the right program for you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003EWhat are your career goals?\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003EWhich style of learning best suits your needs?\u003C/li\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cli\u003EWhat serves the best purpose for your future?\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003EGET NOTICED\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EEffective code schools offer guest\r\nlectures, \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003Evetted instructors\u003C/a\u003E, networking events,\r\nfreelance work, office tours, free tutoring, and other opportunities that help\r\nyou get face time with employers and local stakeholders.

A spark of intuition based on an assumption - that there is a problem or that something could be better, and that we can solve it.

Their ego is holding them back from innovating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAssumption challenging requires confidence and humility - we must be able to acknowledge that we may not have all the answers, or the right ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ECreate the opportunity for success.\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhile there is no blanket solution for discovery, the most direct route to building the right product is to identify what people really want and would actually use.

Cue discount usability (coined by \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.affinitylab.com/news/usability-testing-made-easy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESteve Kreg\u003C/a\u003E) in which you test a limited number of people (usually three) to quickly get initial feedback. Three users!

You do need something to test but there is no need to have a final design. All you need to start getting valuable feedback are low fidelity designs and text. A great example of this is \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.lynda.com/Web-Prototyping-tutorials/UX-Design-Techniques-Paper-Prototyping/161093-2.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Epaper prototyping\u003C/a\u003E, where you essentially have users navigate a website or digital tool by “clicking” on paper. Evaluate where they “click”, how they navigate the interface, and even gauge their facial expressions when using the tool. How do they navigate through it? Is it frustrating to figure out what to do next? Keep your questions open ended and ask the user what problem it is solving for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EDon’t gamble on your product.\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSure, there is a chance that all of your initial assumptions are correct and you won’t get anything out of discovery, but it is very unlikely, and not worth the risk. The probability of creating a better product by investing even a small amount of resources in testing is extraordinarily high. Simply, you cannot come up with a method of learning that replaces watching someone actually engage with your product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe eventual outcome of this learning and discovery is that throughout the product development process, you’ll have the confidence to reject “good enough” solutions. Continuing to explore new ideas and challenge existing assumptions will narrow the divide between what you think people will use and what they actually use. Then, you will have built a truly great product.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGlen Raven had the right attitude about discovery.

This isn’t just true with code. It's also with how I look at life. I’ve always been a deep-thinker, trying to reach out and grasp some kind of greater understanding. Ironically, looking at the tiniest aspect of something can sometimes reveal something new in what we all consider to be the bigger picture. Engineering, philosophy, and science provide this opportunity more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don’t think I would be the programmer I am today if I didn’t bother to look at the bottom-most levels of the tools I’ve used in the past, and the ones that I choose to use today. It’s that “Aha! So that’s how it works” moment that enables you to take the next step forward in your continued development; an education that forces you to constantly evolve as challenges are laid before you on a daily basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning design patterns has enabled me to provide myself with the tools I need in order to conquer these challenges. They have given me the ability to write my own libraries instead of relying upon whatever time-savers dot the web. Let’s take \u003Ca href=\"http://restkit.org/\"\u003ERestKit\u003C/a\u003E for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA library such as RestKit exists so as to provide iOS developers, like myself, a convenient framework with which to spawn asynchronous network connections in order to communicate with a remote service. For most people, there’d be no reason to look deeper beyond the sentence I just wrote. Out-of-the-box, you have all the functionality you need to start hooking-up API calls in order to build an application that easily communicates with the cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for me, that isn’t enough. I personally don’t feel I’m doing my best if I don’t understand what’s going on under the hood. So, in that case, what would I need to write in order to achieve the same result?

About a month ago I graduated from \u003Ca href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/why-a-start-up-ceo-went-to-code-school\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ecode school\u003C/a\u003E and after twelve weeks of intense training, my \u003Ca href=\"http://pladel.io/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Etwo teammates\u003C/a\u003E and I put ourselves through the challenge of designing a \u003Ca href=\"http://pladel.io/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehealth app\u003C/a\u003E in under two and half weeks. What we learned is something that all developers and UX designers know - to create a successful product, the discovery phase has to be thought out, well-planned and well implemented. Here I’ll talk about leveraging lean startup methodology to build software and show exactly how we delivered it in the form of a mobile health app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EPhase One: Discovery (3 days)\u003C/h4\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStep One: Defining the Problem\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/you-cant-really-innovate-without-discovery\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ediscovery phase\u003C/a\u003E of the product development process is critical for uncovering the “real” problems that need to be solved. It’s also important in helping define the initial target audience or user base. The initial product, or minimum viable product (MVP), will need to be tested with that audience or user base to learn as much as possible about them with as little effort as possible. More on this in a minute. Failing to select the correct audience and “jobs” they need to accomplish can kill the product's success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step is to identify the problem. In our case Josh, our lead backend developer, explained that he was having trouble staying motivated and accountable to a health plan called the Primal Blueprint. It was a plan focused more on improving health than bench pressing 300 lbs. or running a three-hour marathon. It focused on improving sleep quality, eating well and moving enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a couple months, he would get bored with his meal plan and return to eating poorly.  Josh also lacked awareness in regards to how he was performing on the plan...he was losing weight and feeling better...but was he sleeping enough? Was he moving enough during the day?  There was no definition of success. So we concluded that the best product to test (the MVP) was a health app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an exercise physiologist I try to keep up with the most recent research. Based upon some recent studies, the current thinking is that maintaining and improving one’s health is not defined only by working out intensely for 30-60 minutes per day (although that is important) it’s also defined by not being sedentary (i.e. resting your backside eight hours per day).  It’s also key, especially when designing a health application, that you have someone on your team that understands the domain.  The more familiar you are with the subject matter the more depth and value you can typically add to a product.  With this in mind we decided to test our assumption that other people had these problems as well. MVP hypothesizing at work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTAvMjAvMTIvMzMvNTAvODY5L1NjcmVlbl9TaG90XzIwMTRfMTBfMjBfYXRfMTIuMTguMzFfUE0ucG5nIl1d/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-20%20at%2012.18.31%20PM.png?sha=45c7afe6\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStep Two: Understand Your Audience\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeation can take on many forms, but when testing a minimum viable product, assumptions have to be made quickly and with a gut feeling. When Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn wanted to test the hypothesis that customers were willing to buy shoes online, he got right down to it. He didn’t build a brand new website or ship in an entire stockroom of shoes, but instead took pictures of a local shoe store’s inventory, posted the pictures online, bought the shoes from the store at full price, and sold them directly to customers. Like Swinburn, we assumed customer demand was present, and in this case it was the demand for a more involved health app they could use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had limited time (literally a day) to complete the hypothesis testing process. I did some basic research on Primal Blueprint, performed some basic audience research by viewing their forums and Facebook page, and had a short storyboarding session with the team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the lean methodology process, we made a number of assumptions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E \r\n\u003Cli\u003EThere were enough people on the Primal Blueprint plan that had problems similar to those Josh was experiencing\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E \r\n\u003Cli\u003EThe initial audience that had the most pain and was most likely to adopt the product early were age 22-30, male leaning, recent college graduates living in metropolitan areas and were Achiever Intellectual archetype (send me a message if you want to know more about this).\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe audience was time constrained but would be willing to self report whether they ate healthy or not if it was simple\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThey had a wearable device or would be willing to purchase one so we could passively aggregate  their data and “score” their progress\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStep Three: Market Assumptions\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotential customers must get involved to make sure there’s interest and need in the product. Avoiding customers’ input would lead to more work, more cost and...well...fat methodology. And no one wants that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after some general assumptions were made, we set off to test their validity.  We posted a simple five-question survey to all the forum members and Facebook followers of the Primal Blueprint. We received 19 completed surveys. Of those, 14 said they were either enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about the product and 12 said they either had a wearable device or would be willing to purchase one.  \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on our limited time, we made the assumption that a larger sample would prove the same results (normally one would perform a much more extensive set of market research to improve confidence).  We also knew that over 250k copies of the Primal Blueprint had been sold and they had over 50k subscribers on their forum.  There was a large enough audience that had the problem to make it worthwhile to solve.  Three of our assumptions had passed enough to take the next steps but one did not. Out of the 14 respondents, 70% were age 30-45, female-leaning parents who lived in metropolitan areas.  Our initial assumption was age 22-30, male-leaning, recent college graduates living in metropolitan areas.  We stuck with the assumption that they were Achiever Intellectual archetype.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedefining our assumptions about our audience based on what we learned from our product discovery phase affected our branding and some functionality of the final prototype. Had we not performed the discovery process and implemented lean methodology, we may have focused on a less engaged audience and wouldn’t know what they needed or wanted. Ultimately, this would have decreased our likelihood for success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKey Takeaways:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E \r\n\u003Cli\u003EStart by figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and then develop a minimum viable product (MVP) to begin the process of learning as quickly as possible. \u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake assumptions about what your customers’ wants and needs are.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGet their feedback.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext month, I’ll be expanding on the lean startup method and the next steps in designing and developing with this in mind.

It isn’t as simple as you’d think. For example, a thread can be spawned and given an associated task which will be completed from start-to-finish. However, what about portions of your task that need to wait for a response before it can proceed further? What do you do with those?  In circumstances like these, Apple has included an event-processing mechanism called a “\u003Ca href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/RunLoopManagement/RunLoopManagement.html\"\u003ERun Loop\u003C/a\u003E”, which simplifies the amount of work a programmer needs to do to account for event-driven code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI previously wrote a post about building an \u003Ca href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/dissecting-third-party-libraries-through-design-patterns/\"\u003Easynchronous networking library\u003C/a\u003E. This article will dive even further into an important part of what makes it work, “Run Loops”, which are integral to performing asynchronous tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first, what is a run loop? Apple’s documentation says:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Run loops are part of the fundamental infrastructure associated with threads. A run loop is an event processing loop that you use to schedule work and coordinate the receipt of incoming events. The purpose of a run loop is to keep your thread busy when there is work to do and put your thread to sleep when there is none.” -Threading Programming Guide: “Run Loops”, Apple Inc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let’s explore this a little further: A “thread” (for those of you reading this who don’t know) is a scheduling mechanism for queueing tasks to be processed by the CPU. These threads are managed by the operating system’s “scheduler”, and given a place in line where they are eventually executed. In the context of a multiprocessor environment, you can execute threads “concurrently” (at the same time). This allows software to perform certain time-consuming tasks in the background without slowing down the responsiveness of the user interface (what we call performing a task “asynchronously”).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere can be some hurdles while performing tasks asynchronously (namely, the synchronization, “re-coupling”, of data), but this is a topic that can be discussed at-length in another article. For now, let’s jump back to how run loops fit in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Cocoa and Cocoa-Touch development, run loops are the mechanism you will utilize to make sure your event-driven, asynchronous task properly responds to any activity that occurs during the lifespan of the thread it is operating within. If the events for the task are not allowed to occur, and aren’t responded to, you risk not acquiring, or utilizing, the data you need to complete the intent of the task. Below is a sample class diagram for the structure of a threaded, asynchronous task:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThread (this can be spawned using NSThread, Grand-Central Dispatch, NSOperation, or “performSelectorInBackground:”)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENSRunLoop/Task\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEvent-Driven Object (this is a class whose functionality requires time to process in order for events associated with it to occur. An example would be a running NSURLConnection object, or a socket)\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from above, the order of encapsulation begins with a thread, continues up the stack with the NSRunLoop and Task associated with it, and then finally into the context of the object which is utilizing the RunLoop. This dependency makes sure that the task has both its own space to operate, and the means to make sure its instructions are fully carried out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo schedule your event-driven object/class within a run loop be sure to call the method below:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"\u003E [\u0026lt;object/class\u0026gt; scheduleInRunLoop:[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] forMode: NSRunLoopCommonModes];\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply scheduling the event-driven object (within your task) inside the current thread’s run loop isn’t enough. You have to tell the run loop when to start polling for events.

(2013)\u0026nbsp;one notable finding involves the negative effect of \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Ebroadcast communications \u003C/em\u003Eon follower growth. Broadcast communications are messages not directed at a specific user or group of users. That is, using Twitter as a bulletin board as opposed to a mode of dyadic (two-way) communication will constrain your number of followers. In turn, \u003Cem\u003Edirected communications\u003C/em\u003E (e.g. replies, ‘@’ mentions, and favorites directed at someone else) have a positive effect on follower growth. Even so, the positive influence of directed communications is not as strong as the negative effect of broadcast communications. Twitter is a conversation platform, evidenced by the marked differences in the effects of communication types on follower growth. Engagement on a one-to-one level between users is the great benefit of social media, why wouldn’t you harness that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3399\" alt=\"2\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"320\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\tResearchers also found that expressing negativity is the second most important factor in stunting follower growth. While talking smack may be a treasured pasttime for close friend groups, the relatively weak relationships found on Twitter makes spewing virtual venom a big no-no. Want to further alienate potential new-followers? Use too many hashtags. The median ratio of hashtags per Tweet during the recorded periods was .13. Respect the power of the tag,\u0026nbsp;if you’re using more than one-two hashtags per 10 Tweets, you’re\u0026nbsp;\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKIpCPS-oZc\"\u003Edoing too much\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\r\n\tRest assured that \r\n\t\u003Cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003Emessage content\u003C/em\u003E variables were not all doom and gloom. Both spreading informational content and writing Tweets worth retweeting were significant predictors of growth. Hutto et al. (2013) define informational content as Tweets containing a URL, “RT”, “MT”, “HT”, or “via” (MT meaning modified Tweet and HT meaning heard through). Unfortunately, the researchers do not provide a formula for creating top Tweets, though being re-elected President \u003Ca title=\"apparently helps\" href=\"https://2012.twitter.com/en/golden-tweets.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003Eapparently helps\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\r\n\tWhile the follower counts of Twitter’s informer class are likely to grow, the platform’s more self obsessed users, or “meformers” are not as lucky. Although users were found to Tweet about themselves more often (41% “meformer” compared to 26% “informer”), informational content is 30 times more effective in attracting new followers. Yes, 30 times. So try and avoid the “humblebrag”. Also, start dropping knowledge or RTing, because new potential followers won’t care about your self-referential blathering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeMande\"\u003E@JoeMande\u003C/a\u003E I'm gonna go ahead and call \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tthb\u0026amp;src=hash\"\u003E#tthb\u003C/a\u003E(triple threat humble brag)\r\n\t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\t\u0026mdash; Chelsea Peretti (@ChelseaVPeretti) \r\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ChelseaVPeretti/statuses/26582494892\"\u003EOctober 6, 2010\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\r\n\t\tThanks to Joe Mande and Chelsea Peretti respectively, for demonstrating a proper #humblebrag and an appropriate public shaming for doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3370\" title=\"The follower of my follower is my friend\" alt=\"The follower of my follower is my friend\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/31.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"320\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhile Hutto el al. (2013) spent relatively less ink discussing the effect of \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Enetwork structure \u003C/em\u003Eon follower growth, the researchers did communicate that greater network overlap between a user and their current followers increases the likelihood of a user attracting new followers. Part of the influence of network overlap (i.e. the number of neighbors users have in common) on follower growth may be associated with the idea of \u003Cem\u003Etriadic closure\u003C/em\u003E. If my follower (B) RTs me (A), and my follower’s follower (X) views and likes the content of that RT, my follower’s follower (X) is more likely to follow me (A). The potential for X to follow A grows the more X is exposed to positive or informational content by A. If multiple users which A and X have in common spread content produced by A, the potential for X to follow A increases. According to Hutto et al. the relationship between A, B, and X achieves “cognitive balance” when all three are connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe relatively simple calculations of users’ \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Ein-link reciprocity\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Eattention status\u003C/em\u003E can alert users whether they need to adjust aspects of their social media strategy. In-link reciprocity is a ratio of a user’s followers, specifically which of their followers a user follows in return. The attention-status ratio is the proportion of a user’s followers to the accounts a user is following. So, in-link reciprocity [User's Followers: User Follows/Follows User] and attention status [Follows User /User Follows] were significant predictors of follower growth with medians of .25 and 1.19 respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3371\" title=\"Popular is as popular does\" alt=\"Popular is as popular does\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/41.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"320\"\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nWithout unpacking the statistical explanation for why higher attention status and in-link reciprocity ratios predict follower growth, I’ll offer my understanding as a relative layperson. Both ratios signal the symmetry, or asymmetry of the relationships between Twitter users. As noted in Golder and Yardi (2010) attention is a limited resource. The very notion of popularity is that more people are aware of the popular individual than he or she can attend to on a regular basis. When applied to Twitter, the higher the ratio of followers a user has compared to accounts they follow (attention-status ratio), the more popular the individual. Based on the research of Hutto et al., the higher a user’s attention-status ratio the greater the likelihood a user will attract new followers. The lesson: popular kids will continue to grow in popularity by virtue of being popular, it’s like high school never ended. However, if a user follows their new followers, the potential for attracting new followers increases as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\r\n\tGolder and Yardi compare the reciprocal nature of following one’s followers as akin to repaying a favor. Through repaying follows, users can solidify social media’s relatively weak bonds and protect themselves against the dreaded unfollowing. Be mindful however, that increases in attention status ratio have a greater effect on attracting new followers than increasing in-link reciprocity. In other terms, have more followers than friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\r\n\tTwitter’s influence can hardly be confined to data sets. Fortunately, how we interact with each other on the platform is more quantifiable as evidenced in the research of Hutto et al.

I was a sophomore in high school and was a member of our newspaper. At the time, I was learning Adobe PageMaker and thought, “wouldn’t it be cool to move from cut and paste on a light table to running our design and production from my Mac?” I convinced our teacher to get us a few Macintosh SEs to help innovate our process. Switching to desktop publishing helped us grow from a bi-monthly newspaper to a monthly newsmagazine and reduced costs significantly. It was my first foray into understanding how software and technology could help drive innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast forward twenty years…as the cofounder of two software start-ups I learned quickly that you could end up running on fumes if you don’t pace your development resources well. As a domain expert in the health and exercise sciences, I didn’t always have enough programming acumen to communicate my vision and users’ needs to our developers. I was also handicapped when meeting with potential customers who had a technical team with questions regarding integration and additional features. It required me to bring a developer to the conversation to field questions and help us understand the potential knots and opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnter Code School\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I shared with friends and family that I was considering immersing myself in code for 12-weeks I received some pretty interesting looks…mostly confused.

I would argue that the landscape of entrepreneurship and product development for startups and early stage software companies is changing.

Then you back off a bit, knowing if you maintain that pace you may crack. Finally, you try to pick it up at the end when the finish line is in sight. All the while there are people supporting you (family, classmates and community).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first month was by far the most challenging. Eighty to one hundred hour weeks were expected if you wanted to keep up. At the end of 10 weeks of learning and hammering out code, we were given two weeks to produce a final product.

We all agreed that if we had it to do over we would have ripped out most of the ruby code and served an API from a Rails framework and built the front end using either Angular or Ember (two front-end frameworks) to give us more flexibility.

We know that a lot of people are thinking about trying to learn how to code (which is totally awesome). It is definitely not too late for anyone to learn, but most people have no idea where to even start. If this sounds familiar, this is the post for you. Since everyone needs a website or has an app idea, the focus of this post is on programming languages that can be used for web or mobile app development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFirst, what is front-end vs. back-end development? Front-end web development describes the visual, user-friendly layer of the website that the user interacts with and is used to collect inputs. Back-end web development uses the inputs that come from the front-end and is composed of servers, applications, and databases. Information is stored by the application in the database, which lives on the server. Mobile development incorporates both front- and back-end development components, but is mostly front-end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tA great analogy from a \u003Ca href=\"http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-front-end-web-development/\"\u003EGeneral Assembly\u003C/a\u003E front-end developer explains that if a website is a car, then the internal components of the car that you can’t see, but that make it run would be the back-end, and the things you can touch/use/hear to make the car move or that make it cool/fun are the front-end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tLet’s dive in to the fun part, what are the best tutorials to use to learn how to code?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003EFront-end Development Languages\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Ch5 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EHTML/CSS\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to make websites pretty.

I found that cheat sheets were great for finding answers quickly and printed them out to have in front of me during the test:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E \r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.blastam.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/handy-google-analytics-reference-guide-80-tips/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBlast Handy Google Analytics Reference Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/temp/intersec-handout.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EPortent Interactive Google Analytics Cheat Sheet 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you’re brave you can try taking the test with just these.

In all the resources I found, they mentioned that the questions are multiple choice but never gave more detail as to exactly what type of multiple choice questions they are (single answer? multiple answer? all of the above?, WHAT?!). In the course and practice test there were a lot of “Select all that apply” multiple choice questions. Well, I hate to say it, but they’re also on the real test. The test questions vary between true/false, single answer, and select all that apply. Additionally, there are either four or five answer choices for each question.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPay attention to time\r\nYou have 90 minutes to complete the test, and the countdown clock in the top right corner of the test window doesn’t let you forget it. You have about a minute and thirty seconds for each question. No pressure, right? However, the pause button is the saving grace. If you get stumped you can pause the test, which will blur out the question and you scan through your resources to find the answer. If you rather not pause the test and continue trucking through you can mark questions you’re not sure of. There is a scrolling list of questions on the right side of the window and you can easily navigate back to the marked ones.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen Resources\r\nSince the test is open book, you can have all your handy resources open in other windows/tabs.

We received some very good feedback but one question in particular really caught my attention: “Would anyone recommend learning Swift or start with Objective-C first? I feel that learning C would give me a better understanding of the internal workings and will lead to better code, but it will take much more time and has a steeper learning curve.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer this question and perhaps the question of many potential iOS developers, I feel that it would be better to start off learning Objective-C before Swift. Let me explain my reasoning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObj-C is an established language. It made its appearance in 1983 making it a little over 30 years old! While Swift may look great it is continuing to evolve and mature over time. Apple’s App Store contains over 1.2 million apps to download and most all of these apps are written in Obj-C. If someone were trying to break into the iOS development industry, hiring managers will be looking for development experience in Obj-C to help maintain their existing apps. It will take time for the majority of iOS developers to completely switch to using Swift for iOS development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Obj-C has been around for so long, you will find that most of the iOS development related questions asked on sites such as StackOverflow are answered with Obj-C code. Many tutorials are also written using Obj-C. Some well-known tutorial sites like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.raywenderlich.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERay Wenderlich.com\u003C/a\u003E are moving to use only Swift for future content which is great, but all the past tutorials are written in Obj-C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will learn Obj-C a lot faster, and after gaining a good understanding of it, learning Swift will be a piece of cake. Swift contains a lot of modern features that will make it more versatile, more concise, and nicer to read and write, but it’s still in its infancy. For the next several years, it will be important for professional iOS developers to have a good grasp of both Objective-C and Swift. One could definitely understand Swift without a good grip on Obj-C but if starting out with iOS development it's better to start with Obj-C. Since Obj-C is a completely different language than Swift it's not required to know, it but if you are thinking about getting into iOS development, it is definitely recommended to learn first. Once you’re familiar with the iOS patterns used to develop apps, you can use exactly the same patterns while writing in both languages, so moving from one language to the other is just a matter of learning the syntax. With Swift, you’re developing apps using the same framework and APIs as you would with Obj-C. I have found that after getting the syntax down, it becomes very simple to write the functionality you want for your app.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInitializing a UIView with size 200x200 and a blue background:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDgvMjcvMDkvMjIvMzAvMzgvU2NyZWVuX1Nob3RfMjAxNF8wOF8yN19hdF85LjIxLjU1X0FNLnBuZyJdXQ/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-27%20at%209.21.55%20AM.png?sha=2f4ea16f\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind this is just my opinion, but it’s definitely worth researching both languages and eventually using both for better app development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are lots of options for learning Obj-C on your own.

Besides, we like to live on the bleeding edge here and I didn’t want to submit to the \u003Ccode\u003E\u0026lt;embed\u0026gt;\u003C/code\u003E tag unless it was the only option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HTML5 \u003Ccode\u003E\u0026lt;audio\u0026gt;\u003C/code\u003E element is still messy at best. Browser audio APIs are improving and moving towards a unified spec but the chart of compatible formats still reads like a pick-three of audio file extensions, with no two browsers picking the same three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhat’s Out There:\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn doing research for this project I came across a lot of tutorials, snippets and plugins that claimed to allow you to use the \u003Ccode\u003E\u0026lt;audio\u0026gt;\u003C/code\u003E tag with impunity. Almost all of these were built using multiple file formats for each audio file and a Flash fallback for older browsers. Most were also meant to be used for embedding songs, podcasts and the like. Of the ones I tested out, the simplest implementations didn’t provide a way to control the player programmatically and the more complex packages took a lot of configuration and had a lot of moving pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Flash fallback route was really the only option for supporting such a wide range of browsers but I wanted a middle-of-the-road solution that would bark on command but wouldn’t attempt to manage my entire MP3 collection for me. Enter \u003Ca href=\"http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eaudio.js\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe audio.js package consists of four files:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Eaudio.min.js\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eaudiojs.swf\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eplayer-graphics.gif\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eindex.css\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s lightweight to say the least and was the quickest to get up and running. It works by creating a JavaScript wrapper around the \u003Ccode\u003E\u0026lt;audio\u0026gt;\u003C/code\u003E element that handles all browser discrepancies and allows you to use code like this:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u0026lt;audio src=\"/mp3/juicy.mp3\" preload=\"auto\" /\u0026gt;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor browsers without \u0026lt;audio\u0026gt; support of some kind, it defaults to the Flash player as expected, but the UI is all built with HTML and CSS and updated via JavaScript, so the user will see the same player no matter what their browser supports. Player appearance was admittedly not the biggest issue here since it would be hidden most of the time but it was one less thing to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about browser support?

Flash is listed as caveat more often than not but with JavaScript hooks to control the player instance I didn’t have to worry about what type of player\u0026nbsp; was being loaded in order to play a file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was love on \u003Ccode\u003E$(document).ready()\u003C/code\u003E.

When testing in IE, I was plagued with an “Object doesn’t support this property or method” error for a while that had to do with how I was procedurally loading the audio files. A few hurdles, but nothing to put me off for good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may be better audio solutions out there but this is one of the simplest and most functional I’ve seen.

Growth Hacking combines marketing with technology and is a technique used primarily by startups that don’t have money or experience to implement a big marketing campaign. Ryan Holliday of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3003888/everything-marketing-how-growth-hackers-redefine-game\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EFast Company\u003C/a\u003E said, “Because [startups] didn't have access to the \"luxuries\" of an ad budget or the burden of proper training, they were able to be creative enough to broaden the definition of marketing to immense advantage.” The term “\u003Ca href=\"http://www.startup-marketing.com/where-are-all-the-growth-hackers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Egrowth hacker\u003C/a\u003E” was first seen in a blog post by Sean Ellis in 2010. He had meant it to be for the scrappy startups who didn’t have the resources for a traditional approach to market their product. He said, “A growth hacker is a person whose true North is growth,\" meaning every action is done to promote growth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EEnter Growth Engineering\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tGrowth Engineering builds on the core principle of Growth Hacking: growing the user base! Accruing users is the sole purpose of anything with “growth” in front of it. Obviously you can’t increase users without using some more traditional marketing strategies and techniques, like social media, email, and content marketing, but the difference is the end goal and the methods used to achieve that goal. The traditional methods focus on brand awareness and thought leadership, drawing people to the site or app in the first place. Growth Engineering focuses on keeping them there, and turning the casual user into a brand advocate. In the great words of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkTb7Pe2MtY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETron\u003C/a\u003E, “I fight for the users” - that’s what we growth engineers do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBut there is more to Growth Engineering than a more grown up name. This brings us to the second great love of growth engineers: data. A large component of Growth Engineering is testing, data mining, and trend analyzing that gives the holistic view of user’s interactions and leads to user retention. Growth engineers want to measure and increase user conversion at every step of the way to truly understand why and which users convert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/growth_engineering-3.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5487\" alt=\"growth_engineering (3)\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/growth_engineering-3.png\" width=\"612\" height=\"1340\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWho Benefits from Growth Engineering\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tGrowth services are applicable to businesses with a web or mobile product. For example, a company trying to drive traffic to an ecommerce site and then increase conversions would benefit greatly from Growth services. Their Growth team would be able to test sale funnels, set up heat-maps, analyze retention and referrals, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOf course, Growth Engineering is not for everyone. For instance, if a product startup is trying to get brand recognition with a guerrilla marketing campaign, as opposed to a digital marketing initiative, Growth Engineering is not for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EUsing Growth Engineering to Compound Your Marketing Efforts\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tTo build upon your current marketing efforts, Growth Engineers can also employ Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, and other Search Engine Marketing (SEM) tactics that increase site traffic. The key differentiator between traditional marketing efforts and Growth Engineering is the focus on getting users to stay, convert, and return time after time to use your product. Growth Engineers focus on testable aspects of a site where the data will tell them what is or is not working so they can optimize the user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EWhere Can I Find Growth Engineering Services?\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWe are excited to announce that Smashing Boxes is now available to assist companies with Growth Engineering.

However, these reports will require a more advanced setup to actually gather data you need. For example, if you have an e-commerce site, you will need to collect data that is specific to your purchase funnel. For more complex steps like this you may need to talk to your web developer or an analytics service provider to assist you (we’ll have more on e-commerce later in this series).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHere are some analytics tips that anyone with admin access to your Google Analytics can tackle that will allow you to better understand your users.

Check that the tracking code is in the head tag of your website. A simple test to check this is to visit the \r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003EReal Time\u003C/strong\u003E tab in Google Analytics Reporting while you are on the site to see if it shows that you are active on the site.\r\n\t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\t2.

Best practice is to first add the filter to your \u003Cstrong\u003ETest\u003C/strong\u003E view to check if it is filtering your data as expected.

If you have a search bar on your site, make sure you are tracking what people are searching for. This is NOT Keyword tracking, which Google has reduced the usability of with most showing up as (not provided). However if your site has a search bar on it, you can see what terms users are searching for.

Although Kent Beck is often credited with the discovery of TDD, he himself \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.quora.com/Test-Driven-Development/Why-does-Kent-Beck-refer-to-the-rediscovery-of-test-driven-development\"\u003Esays he found it described in an ancient book about programming on tape\u003C/a\u003E. The book described manually typing the expected output on one tape and then programming until the actual output matches the expected output. The principle may have been around earlier but Kent Beck is responsible for popularizing it through his 2002 book, \u003Cem\u003ETest-Driven Development: By Example\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThis \"test-first\" concept is in opposition to our natural instinct to start writing code as soon as we come up with an implementation in our head, however naïve it may be. But what some developers don't realize is that by writing code without tests, they are relying on a poor man's TDD. The developer writes a tentative method, then starts a debugger and manually triggers the method with ad hoc data. As soon as it seems to be working, he moves on to other code. Periodically the developer runs the entire application and performs a few sanity checks just to be sure everything works together. Finally, the code is deployed and the inevitable bug reports stream in. Bugs are patched quickly, often uncovering new bugs which are sometimes caught before they go live on production. Assuming the application doesn't require constant addition of new features, the app continues running and the frequency of bug reports gradually lessens until finally an equilibrium is reached in which all bugs are either fixed or are well-enough understood to be considered \"quirks\" or even \"features\".\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nTDD encourages developers to admit that each line of code needs testing. Rather than testing in an ad hoc way, a test framework should be used in order to explicitly define tests. And if we're going to write tests for our code, why not write the test first so that we have something with which to check our work? TDD is the logical conclusion of the premise that tests help us write better code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nWriting a test in the Test Driven Development style is similar to the old practice of typing expected output on tape. If we know our inputs we should have an expectation about what the exact output of our code will be. We can't test every possible value for each input, but we can at least test an expected range of values. Code should be written in such a way as to handle values that are outside of expected ranges.

His main concern with TDD centers around the possibility of design damage due to a dogmatic test-drivenness that insists on keeping tests fast at all costs, extensive mocking,  and 100% coverage at the unit level. Kent Beck and Martin Fowler, both proponents of TDD, \u003Ca href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/\"\u003Eheld a series of conversations\u003C/a\u003E with David in which they each described the benefits and shortcomings of TDD and attempted to clear up some misconceptions about the terminology and best practices associated with TDD. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs influential as each of them are, their opinions will continue to influence developers as they face the same trade-offs. The debate will continue at least until we come up with better practices, but many fundamental things will stay the same. All engineering involves trade-offs, so there will never be a silver bullet that solves all problems. We shouldn't neglect the collected wisdom of those who have gone before us. If we do neglect their experiences, we will inevitably repeat their mistakes and make their discoveries vain as we struggle to re-discover on our own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn future blog posts, I will look more at the evidence that TDD works, look at some practical examples, and explore alternatives to TDD.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECheck out TDD for beginners \u003Ca href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/beginners-guide-to-test-driven-development-tdd\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"tdd-part-1-background","slug_history":[],"visits":3140,"published_at":"2014-09-12T00:33:40.024-04:00","author_name":"Reed Law","category_id":1,"image_uid":"2014/09/11/12/32/31/509/file","created_at":"2014-09-10T05:57:52.526-04:00","updated_at":"2015-06-15T15:16:37.244-04:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":null,"featured":false},{"id":295,"title":"Balsamiq Hack","summary":"There are many things that I love about using Balsamiq Mockups.

Just add a small element to the page and drag it far down to the bottom right, farther than you feel you’ll need space for your mockup.

And for anyone who lives outside of that city, the brand can have a significant impact on the way they feel about it, whether they would visit, do business, or even move there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut branding goes deeper than an image. With the world as globalized and networked as it is, every city has to compete for tourists, investment, capital, business, attention, and even respect. How cities communicate their soul and success is crucial for deciding which ones succeed and which ones fail in the rivalry for economic prosperity. In this sense, cities are like companies. Those with a strong and powerful brand have an easier time selling their products and services that are attractive to people and investors.

Gaining access to the desktop means Chrome Apps can perform offline functionality without having to rely on Local Storage and the size limitations that come with it, or on the more fully-featured but \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag\"\u003Esignificantly more complex Application Cache\u003C/a\u003E.

Web technologies have been mature enough to create attractive, responsive interfaces for some time now, but a browser is still needed in most cases to render the code. Chrome Apps have none of the standard Chrome browser controls, so visually they can look like anything. Even native desktop apps are typically governed to some extend by the design of the parent OS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe challenge and opportunity exists in taking advantage of this paradigm shift in app definition. The Web can’t do everything, but it’s well on it’s way. Data-centric apps are prime targets and well-suited to the Chrome platform. Every successful app that runs in the browser \u0026mdash; think Mint, Soundcloud, Facebook, Hulu, not to mention Google Apps as a whole \u0026mdash; are all prime examples of what is possible with the browser.

This snippet is called the container. The container needs to be placed in\u0026nbsp;immediately after the opening \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tag.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tEx. of a GTM container:\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ccode\u003E\u0026lt;!-- Google Tag Manager --\u0026gt;\r\n\r\n\t\u0026lt;noscript\u0026gt;\u0026lt;iframe src=\"//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXX\"\r\n\r\n\theight=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"display:none;visibility:hidden\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/noscript\u0026gt;\r\n\r\n\t\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\r\n\r\n\tnew Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\r\n\r\n\tj=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'\u0026amp;l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\r\n\r\n\t'//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\r\n\r\n\t})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r\n\r\n\t\u0026lt;!-- End Google Tag Manager --\u0026gt;\r\n\r\n\t\u003C/code\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\tOnce the container is loaded on your site you will never have to hardcode for an event again! Setting up an event in GTM is similar to the “old way” of event tracking. You still need to identify a category, action, label, value, and non-interaction. You can see in the image below that the same identifiers are used as the example before, but there is something different in the label text box.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NdN2_gBJKX5Tix5kLlDhiS9Pjw0BSVXyrj8dl3fxQqmiwwvTm8xgkvWycKdzTLK9k4rdapS7S2d5OcqHY0KRN_kpYMwzXIcIlZgi8sC4yckweQ7tm7raxbeL4aPaNdYGvg\" width=\"556px;\" height=\"520px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"\"\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhat is in the text box is called a macro. This macro will return the id attribute of the element that was clicked. Going back to the example above it will return “Product1”. This makes tagging easier because this one tag will work for every PDF on your site that has an id; just make sure your developer gives each a clear and unique id. You do not have to create a tag for individual PDFs on your site.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tYou can learn even more about your website and its users by becoming versed in Google Analytics and taking the\u0026nbsp;\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/tips-for-passing-the-2014-google-analytics-exam\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGAIQ Exam\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t*With \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ross-ozburn/35/654/63a\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERoss Ozburn\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"google-tag-manager-and-event-tracking","slug_history":[],"visits":1247,"published_at":"2014-10-30T10:48:24.244-04:00","author_name":"Alicia Midland","category_id":2,"image_uid":"2014/10/29/13/12/24/145/file","created_at":"2014-10-29T12:15:39.586-04:00","updated_at":"2014-10-30T10:51:02.558-04:00","markdown":null,"image_alt_text":null,"featured":false},{"id":235,"title":"The Impact of Healthcare IT: The Lay of the Land","summary":"An interview series with Mark Braunstein, Director of the Health Systems Institute at Georgia Tech, and columnist at InformationWeek.

I think being a designer and loving problem solving is just part of your job. As a developer it’s the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003EYou had a partner on this book, Mark Lavin. Tell me a little bit about how that came about.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tMark and I actually worked at Caktus Consulting Group for a few years and we just really enjoy working together and work well together.

It’s a great community to be involved with. It’s something I’ve been doing for awhile now and this book is really about de-mystifying Django. It’s just a lot of fun to be able to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003ERight now your book is on early release, “raw and unedited,”\u0026nbsp; what exactly does that mean, what’s the thought behind that and when can we expect the final product? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe early release is really meant to get a backing\u0026hellip;it’s really just to create some buzz and get people excited about this awesome new thing that is going to be part of the Django community and Python community and also Javascript as well. The book really brings in this sort of client side, back end infrastructure, how those two meet, how they work together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003ESo tell us a little bit about what audience this book is designed for and what you hope they take away from it?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe audience is really for people who don’t have a lot of experience bringing in client-side and back-end work into a Django environment.

I’m a person who likes challenges and I don’t understand the concept of boredom so really it was like what’s the next challenge for me and my career?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat kind of advice would you give to other programmers who might follow down the same path of authorship?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFind something that you love.

So, once you come up with an mHealth app idea, how do you differentiate your app and ensure that health care professionals and/or consumers will actually use yours when the landscape is so crowded?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDoes your app solve a legitimate health problem?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe most important driver for an mHealth app should be that it solves a valid pain point in healthcare. There are many areas of health that still need solutions and mHealth has the potential to solve many existing and emerging issues help people save on healthcare expenditures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs your app easy to use?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nDoctors and consumers are busy with their jobs and everyday lives, so they are unlikely to use anything that requires too much extra effort. When designing an app, you want to maximize the value it provides for everyone who is using it, whether the app is saving time for doctors who are interacting with patients through a messaging platform or facilitating access to health information for patients on the go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDoes a solution already exist? If so, what makes your solution better?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe mHealth market is competitive, so it is important to do research ahead of time to ensure that your time isn’t being wasted developing something that is already on the market and has a large following. Differentiate yourself by talking to health care professionals and consumers before and while building your app so that you know you are building something that serves a purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDoes your app empower patients?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nPatient empowerment is key to changing and improving long-term patient behavior, especially for medication adherence and other preventative health measures. If your app enables people to take control of their health outcomes and facilitates healthy behavior, healthcare professionals are more likely to see the benefits of the app and prescribe it to their patients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWill your app require FDA approval?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nRecently, the FDA published guidelines outlining the types of apps that they will be regulating.

Believe it or not, under all that new flat prettyness lies a ton of neat new APIs and frameworks! I am going to briefly go into a new tool for iOS developers called UIKit Dynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUIKit Dynamics is a full physics engine integrated into UIKit. Using UIKit Dynamics allows developers to create user interfaces that feel real. This means that UI objects can be considered physical objects that respond to gestures, touches, and changes to orientation. Developers may add behaviors such as gravity, attachments, and forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant to see this in action? Go ahead and pull out your iPhone (sorry Android users!). On the lock screen there is a camera icon in the bottom right to allow you to quickly navigate to your camera app. Tap and hold on the icon and drag the screen almost half way up – now let go and watch what happens. Did you see the bounce effect at the bottom of the screen? Try again, but this time only drag the view up so you can just see the take picture button. You will notice there was even less bounce. Now the fun part. Do the same thing, but instead of just letting it go, swipe your finger toward the bottom of the screen like you’re throwing the view down. You will noticeably see a larger bounce from the view depending how fast you swiped the view and if you swipe it fast enough, it will bounce all the way up and launch the camera app!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this example I will add a 100×100 square (green) at the top of my view. I will then add a barrier bar (yellow) about half way down the view. The square will drop from the top (gravity) and bounce off the bar (collision) and then bounce to the bottom of the view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing just these lines of code to add gravity, collision, and item behavior:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image1.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4319\" alt=\"UIKit Dynamics: Gravity, Collision, Item Behavior\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image1.png\" width=\"867\" height=\"401\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProduces the output of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image2.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4320\" alt=\"UIKit Dynamics Code Output\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image2.png\" width=\"434\" height=\"704\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see the square drops from the top of the view and settles at the bottom.

Behind each option is at least one rule determining what happens once an action is triggered. Interaction rules are the most fundamental part of an interaction design, affecting everything from the level of user control, to timing and event order, feedback, what happens at the end of an interaction, and more (check out Dan Saffer’s\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://microinteractions.com/\"\u003EMicrointeractions\u003C/a\u003E book, for more on rules and interaction structure). There are many factors affecting the usage speed of an application, we will primarily be examining interaction rules in an attempt to demonstrate how their effective design can help make applications easier and faster to use. In short, elimination of options, and their corresponding rules, leads to faster usage speed. Once the design has reached the maximum level of simplicity, there are still many ways to increase usage speed, including creative design based on user research, and elimination of usage error potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tApplication rule sets can be simple or quite extensive. As an example, let’s look at some possible rules for a photo sharing application. The rule set for such an application might contain the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli\u003EIf the user is on a photo album page and “Edit album” is selected, display an editable album title field and a list of photographs.\u003C/li\u003E\t\u003Cli\u003EIf at least one photo is selected, display “Delete selected” and “Move selected” buttons.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn the above example, the “Delete selected” and “Move selected” buttons appear only when at least one image has been selected. Irrelevant options remain hidden until the user makes them relevant. It’s in this manner that effective rule design can increase usability by limiting user options. Generally speaking, the fewer the options, the fewer the rules, and the faster the usage speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe challenge of rule design is knowing your user group well enough to hide or eliminate certain options in a way that feels useful and non-restrictive. Hiding options and revealing them when the time is right, through progressive disclosure, is generally more effective than removing options and content (Check out Jacob Nielsen’s book,\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/books/mobile-usability/\"\u003EMobile Usability\u003C/a\u003E, p. 60 for more on progressive disclosure). This technique can be quite effective if proper trigger affordances are built in to the design so users know how to find hidden content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAlthough simplification through elimination of options does wonders for speed of use, there is a point at which further simplification would negatively impact usability. \u0026nbsp;At this point, the challenge becomes knowing how to work with the necessary complexities. \u0026nbsp;Larry Tesler, inventor of the cut-and-paste interaction, constructed a law to address the limitations of simplification. According to Tesler’s Law, all activities have inherent complexity, so there is a point at which simplification is no longer an option (Saffer,\u0026nbsp;\u003Cem\u003EMicrointeractions\u003C/em\u003E, p. 67). Accepting such limitations can be challenging, but there is often still ample room for creativity within such constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIf user research and testing has been conducted, there are probably many ways to further a design, even under tight constraints and with only basic knowledge of user requirements. As a simple example, let’s look at designing a time picker for an event planning company. With just a small amount of user information, like the fact that users will only create events on or thirty minutes past the hour, we can already begin making more effective decisions. Out of the box most time pickers provide a drop-down list of all hours, and a separate drop-down menu list of all minutes to choose from. If we provide two long lists fill with mostly useless options, the time selection interaction will surely come up short. With basic knowledge of event times, long hour and minutes lists can be combined into one simple list of times in 30-minute increments. A meeting will never be scheduled for\u0026nbsp;10:03pm, so there is no need to include\u0026nbsp;10:03 as a selection choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAfter user research, one way to potentially improve interactions is through error prevention. If users of an application easily make mistakes, the design has great potential for improvement through error prevention design. The goal with many designs is to make it impossible for users to do something wrong. However, it is possible to achieve zero or low usage error potential with varying degrees of success. There are different ways to reduce or eliminate usage error potential, but the best approaches take usage flow into consideration. If an application has hundreds of pop-ups, users may never be able to make a mistake, but it will probably feel like hundreds of mistakes have been made-especially if audio feedback accompanies those popups. It may work to eliminate popups, but it will most likely not work to eliminate confirmation questions. One way to mitigate the disruption that a pop-up can create, while maintaining sound error prevention through confirmation checks is with interactive tooltips. A tooltip is subtle enough, when tastefully designed, that it will not overtly interrupt the experience. Since users are focusing directly where the tooltip appears, discoverability is also very high. The combination of high discoverability and marginal disruption of the experience makes tooltips ideal for many error prevention designs. Let’s look at applying tooltip error prevention to a photo sharing application. If one decides to edit a photo album within such an application, making sure to confirm user intent to delete photos is important. Instead of using pop-ups to display confirmation messages, let’s use an interactive tooltip on the delete button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp id=\"attachment_4436\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tooltip_confirmation.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\" wp-image-4436 \" alt=\"Tooltip Example\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tooltip_confirmation.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003E\r\n\tIn the example above, error confirmation messaging has been incorporated in an unobtrusive way. There is less time and effort required to confirm intent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn some cases, especially with touch screen devices, we could make creative use of gestures for error prevention. Instead of confirming intent with a pop-up, or tooltip, we could require users to make a long swipe gesture in a highlighted area. This swipe trigger could be used in place of a tap trigger, which is final once a user interacts with it. With a swipe, users can decide to stop even after they have started swiping. Also, requiring prolonged intentional focus on the trigger activation lowers the chances of doing something by accident. A great example of this is found in the iOS7 lock and power off screens. An\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3017236/apples-ios-7-redefines-industrial-design-through-evil-skeuomorphism\"\u003Eevolved form of skeuomorphism\u003C/a\u003E is used effectively in iOS7 interaction design to make things more intuitive and faster to use. The power off screen has a ‘slide to power off’ area at the top and a cancel button all the way at the bottom as far away from the top as possible. A swipe is required to trigger a device shutdown, while simply canceling out of the shutdown screen only requires a tap. In order to even reach the shutdown screen a user must first press and hold the power button. Additionally, through the physical mechanics of the button, users receive both haptic and audio feedback as it is pressed. The subtleties of such interactions, allows for a seamless and fast experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAfter looking at the examples above, we can begin to see there is great potential to improve usage speed through simplification of interactions, user research, and more.\u0026nbsp;Comment below if you have any suggestions or remarks about how usage speed can be improved!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

In WordPress you have posts and custom post types, Drupal has the all powerful node and ExpressionEngine has…channels. The structure of an entry is dictated by the channel it is published in and the fields that channel has. EE’s content storage system is fairly straightforward when implementing a simple brochure site or blog where post types are few and their structure is simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe College of Design site however, functions as an informational portal for the department within the larger University. On top of hundreds of informational pages across multiple sections there are staff profiles, galleries of work, dynamically generated content sliders, dynamic backgrounds — and that’s just on the homepage. Well-defined content structure is important in any project and was absolutely vital in this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tThe Problem with Pages\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAs mentioned above, most of ExpressionEngine’s content management happens via channels. There is the concept of a Page in the vanilla EE install but it’s disabled by default and encapsulated in a separate module. The College of Design site called for hierarchical page relationships with different templates for parent and child pages. It’s a a relatively common mode of organization but proved difficult to implement with channels alone. Therefore, I was faced with an unsavory choice: build and configure the channels so all entries are easily accessible from the same template, or build a template with conditional logic for every sub-category and content type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe first option makes the front-end code much simpler but results in all the hierarchical content being chucked into the same “bucket” within the CMS, making actual content management a nightmare. The second option makes for templates bloated with conditional statements and hard-coded constants that are then duplicated for each section within the hierarchy. Both would solve the problem but the concessions involved in each were more than I was willing to stomach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tDeus Ex Taxonomy\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAfter the channel-based publishing, the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the plugin ecosystem. To its credit, EE is very flexible once you understand how to use it. However, like most content management systems, not all the functionality you want exists out-of-the-box. There is the possibility of extension via modules and plugins but since ExpressionEngine is proprietary software, so too are many of the plugins. Perhaps this is reasonable, but it’s a hard pill to swallow for someone accustomed to building with open source tools. If the WordPress Plugin Directory is a Chinese buffet,  then EE charges you $5 for water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tStill, despite much grumbling and dragging of feet, I eventually found my magic bullet in the form of Taxonomy. With it I was able to build hierarchical menus entirely independent of the underlying channel structure and provide override links to any URL on a per-item basis. Entries could now be organized in as many channels as necessary while appearing as one logical section to the user. At the code level I only needed to add a few template tags rather than building a self-generating menu system from the ground up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBelow is the code for a custom menu on one of the departmental landing pages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAs you can see, there are lots of conditionals. Additionally, there’s plenty of fiddling around with URL slugs and entry IDs to get the URL structure to appear right on “sub” pages. It works for this purpose but it’s too specific to use elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\n\tEnter Taxonomy:\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt’s much more concise to say the least. Taxonomy does all the footwork of building out sub-navs, adding active classes and handling URLs. Granted, there is still some configuration overhead and there are several options and functions that I didn’t use for this build. Even so, dropping Taxonomy in was akin to sweeping that CRT monitor onto the floor and replacing it with one of those new hypercrystal OLED widescreen cinema displays. You know, the ones with the iPod dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECover photo by \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marfis75/\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMartin Fisch\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"flexible-hierarchical-navigation","slug_history":[],"visits":994,"published_at":"2012-10-11T04:00:00.000-04:00","author_name":"Biko Tushinde","category_id":1,"image_uid":"2014/07/29/17/25/13/153/file","created_at":"2014-06-05T14:24:44.588-04:00","updated_at":"2015-06-15T15:22:33.842-04:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":null,"featured":false},{"id":349,"title":" Watch - Relevant to Healthcare?","summary":"As a hospitalist at Duke University who takes care of both children and adults, as well as the Director of Mobile Technology Strategy, I get to take care of patients both one at a time as well as a million at a time.

It would have been an extreme disappointment if the event ended \r\n\t\u003Cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E the announcement of a new product category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOf course, everyone figured it would be a watch, but just like the previous announcements in 2007 and 2010, no one had any idea what it would look like or what it would do.  Apple is \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Every good\u003C/em\u003E at secrecy when mass manufacturing for a product hasn't yet commenced, or when the product includes new software (as evidenced by the surprise announcement of the \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESwift programming language\u003C/a\u003E in June).  Both were true in case.  Prior to the announcement, the  Watch, as it is now known, had been produced in only limited test quantities, and the new version of iOS that it runs had never before been seen publicly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe  Watch was announced in the context of the prior announcement of HealthKit in June.  Special emphasis has been placed on the health and fitness features of the watch, with Apple going as far as producing a \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/films/#film-fitness\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eseparate promotional video\u003C/a\u003E highlighting this use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThat said, the expectations for what this watch would do for health and fitness bordered on magical.  Sources as reliable as the Wall Street Journal predicted that the device would \"\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-multiple-designs-for-smartwatch-1403245062\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Einclude up to 10 sensors.\u003C/a\u003E\"  With current technology, I couldn't imagine how that many high-quality sensors could be included in a 1st generation product while still maintaining a reasonable size, cost and battery life.  Sure enough, the actual product was more firmly grounded in reality, with just a single medical sensor to measure pulse, in addition to the activity tracking of the M8 chip and the new barometric functionality to measure elevation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt's quite likely that these rumors have some basis in fact, however.  The  Watch is the most intimate product ever created by Apple, and I'm not just referring to the ability to share your heartbeat with that special someone.  It's a device that is in \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Econstant contact with your skin\u003C/em\u003E.  Just that fact alone opens the door for many sensors beyond simple measurement of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/technology/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eheart rate\u003C/a\u003E.  In fact, I'd wager that the  Watch could open the floodgates to R\u0026amp;D into transcutaneous sensors, with the potential to transform how we see ourselves.  The \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Equantified self\u003C/a\u003E has just gotten much closer to reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSo what can the  Watch do for healthcare right now?  At the very least, the profile of wearable electronics will get a huge boost in the consumer sector.  They will become more socially acceptable, and users will come to rely on them and even \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Etrust them\u003C/em\u003E to make meaningful differences in their lives.  Laying this foundation now will be critical to encourage the adoption of more advanced wearable sensors in future devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHow useful the watch ends up being for consumer health and fitness will ultimately come down to the combination of hardware \r\n\t\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E software.  The fact that all of this data will be saved to HealthKit is very attractive, because the data can then be shared with \u003Cem\u003Eany \u003C/em\u003Eother HealthKit-enabled health or fitness app the user chooses.  Giving this power to the user is a smart move, and will likely foster a more open and diverse ecosystem of useful health and fitness apps moving forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWith respect to use of the  Watch in the clinical setting, I love learning about and using new technology, but I’m also cognizant that the modern reality of electronic medical records has resulted in tension within the physician-patient relationship.  During a typical visit, physicians often find themselves staring at a computer screen rather than interacting with the patient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn medical school we were taught the Latin phrase, “primum, non nocere” or, “first, do no harm.”  When technology interferes with the relationship we have with our patients, harm is being done.  When technology enhances our work while remaining transparent to the interaction, we can make progress.  Technologies such as the  Watch have the potential to take us a step in that direction by providing another avenue for relatively unobtrusive data access.  As a developer myself, I’m looking forward to the arrival of the WatchKit SDK so I can see more fully how this functionality might be integrated into our medical environment, both from the perspective of a user as well as a physician.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\"When technology interferes with the relationship we have with our patients, harm is being done. When technology enhances our work while remaining transparent to the interaction, we can make progress.\"\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHow could the watch be improved?  It'll be easier to see once the watch has been released and the limitations become more apparent.  But for starters, the watch needs to be waterproof.  While there's no official statement on this, \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-watch-update-more-details-and-hands-on-97091024129.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EDavid Pogue revealed\u003C/a\u003E that it's likely just water resistant.  I'm an avid swimmer, and one of the reasons I love my \u003Ca href=\"https://getpebble.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EPebble Smartwatch\u003C/a\u003E is because I never have to take it off (plus, it lasts up to 5-7 days per charge).  This would be critical for any users whose primary form of physical activity involves water sports.  Many of our patients who participate in cardiac rehab are often involved in water aerobics, and they would have to remove the watch to participate, thus nullifying much of the activity tracking benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBattery life also needs to be at least several days.  I've heard some lamentations that the watch doesn't have sleep tracking functionality like some of the other popular wearables.  If the  Watch has a battery life of only 24 hours as rumored, sleep tracking would be an\u0026nbsp;impossibility given that the watch would need to charged at night, every night.  The watch also appears a bit too bulky in its current iteration to keep on while sleeping (in my opinion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tI'm confident all these issues will be resolved over time in future iterations of the watch (or competing watches).  Progress will continue and app developers will surely come up with uses that Apple hasn't even considered.  Mobile health innovators should pay close attention to this new product category.  It will eventually revolutionize how we care for our patients and ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis article\u0026nbsp;was originally posted on\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.rickybloomfield.com/2014/09/watch-relevant-to-healthcare.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERicky Bloomfield's blog\u003C/a\u003E.\u0026nbsp;Dr. Bloomfield is the Director of Mobile Technology Strategy as well as Assistant Professor in Internal Medicine \u0026amp; Pediatrics at Duke University.

Not only was setting-up the library quick and easy, but it looked great out of the box. What really amazed me was the customization ViewDeck allows. Depending on the iOS device running the app, you can adjust how far on-screen the controllers can be swiped. On an iPhone you’re able to better utilize its lower resolution to focus on the controller being swiped into view (Fig. 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp id=\"attachment_3437\" style=\"width: 266px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg class=\" wp-image-3437 \" alt=\"Figure 1. iPhone Screenshot\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/iOS-Simulator-Screen-shot-May-9-2013-4.08.02-PM.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"384\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003EFigure 1. iPhone Screenshot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhile on the iPad, you’re able to take advantage of its higher screen resolution to display both controllers (Fig. 2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp id=\"attachment_3433\" style=\"width: 416px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg class=\" wp-image-3433 \" alt=\"Figure 2. iPad Screenshot\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/iOS-Simulator-Screen-shot-May-9-2013-3.42.14-PM.png\" width=\"406\" height=\"540\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem\u003EFigure 2. iPad Screenshot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBy changing the controller’s size through ViewDeck, you don’t have to worry about resizing the frame, it’s all handled for you (especially if you use resizers on your objects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHere’s the code required:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-3642 alignnone\" alt=\"Screenshot of ViewDeck Implementation \" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-10-at-2.12.06-PM.png\" width=\"551\" height=\"122\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tViewDeck also allows you to change the left and right controllers during run-time. For our example project, the run-time functionality restricts the ability to access the left or right controllers under certain conditions. For example, only granting access to the right controller on a subset of screens, but allowing the left controller to be present on every screen. The example app also features a screen dedicated to presentation mode, providing the user access to a full screen view of their document. During the full screen view, the left and right controllers are disabled so the user can interact with the document naturally. Once the user exits presentation mode, the application restores access to the left/right controllers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAnother way to use ViewDeck is to customize where a swipe can occur to summon the left/right controllers. On one screen, I’m using a scrollView that would normally be overridden by the gesture recognition ViewDeck uses. By using the panning property, we can apply the ViewDeck swipe gestures to specific Views and leave the rest of the screen to navigate normally. In addition to ViewDeck’s default left/right controllers, the panning property allows a vertically/horizontally scrolling scrollView.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFeel free to leave a comment if you have any questions or want to mention a favorite iOS library that you use!\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"messing-with-viewdeck","slug_history":[],"visits":613,"published_at":"2013-05-15T04:00:00.000-04:00","author_name":"Eric Harmon","category_id":4,"image_uid":"2014/07/21/13/33/25/48/file","created_at":"2014-06-05T14:23:27.521-04:00","updated_at":"2015-06-15T15:21:19.020-04:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":null,"featured":false},{"id":245,"title":"Image Preview with Dragonfly Gem","summary":"The Dragonfly gem is a really efficient way for a rails project to support on the fly image resizing and processing.

That prototype’s prototype will be the prototype of the object you are extending (i.e. \u003Cstrong\u003Egoogle.maps.InfoWindow.prototype\u003C/strong\u003E). This allows you to augment \u003Cstrong\u003Egoogle.maps.InfoWindow\u003C/strong\u003E and even write methods of the same name on your child class without clobberring the parent. To access the parent’s method of the same name, coffeescript provides the keyword ‘\u003Cstrong\u003Esuper\u003C/strong\u003E‘.

To accomplish this, I extend \u003Cstrong\u003Egoogle.maps.InfoWindow\u003C/strong\u003E into my own class, define an ‘\u003Cstrong\u003Eopen\u003C/strong\u003E‘ method, and have it wrap the native one by using the ‘\u003Cstrong\u003Esuper\u003C/strong\u003E‘ keyword. This allows me to abstract away the first parameter (instance variable \u003Cstrong\u003E@_map\u003C/strong\u003E) so I do not need to supply it each time I call \u003Cstrong\u003E.open()\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ability to extend classes provides a clean and simple way to augment libraries you use and write code at a higher level.

I don’t just want rock stars who can sit in a cubicle and crank out code. I want engaged, passionate people who seek out opportunities to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I look across this group, and after meeting many of you last night, I see that passion for learning. After all, each of you have dedicated your own time and money for the privilege of getting your butt kicked for the next three months. There’s a lot to be said for that! But, as you can imagine, the journey doesn’t end there. Several years ago, I was part of a group that crafted something called the \u003Ca href=\"http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/\"\u003ESoftware Craftsmanship Manifesto\u003C/a\u003E. The central tenant of that manifesto was the notion that we need to treat what we do as a craft - and the learning for a craft never stops. We need to always be curious about not only our discipline, but those around us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, when you finish here and are ready to head out to the 'real world,' that ideal of curiosity is one of the four key things you’ll want to hone here. Technology is changing - when I first started out, we used Basic, C++, Visual Basic, Classic ASP, Foxpro, Cold Fusion and Javascript - many which are still around today. But engineers who don’t stay curious - who aren’t questioning the why of things, and the what’s next - may find the world, and language, they know is quite different. But for you - your curiosity is evident already - it’s why you are here! Don’t let that go away from you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing that struck me as so wonderful meeting you all is the passion you have. Each of you have different paths of how you got here, but in no case did I meet someone (so far!) who said, “Well, I really had nothing better to do, so I figured I’d just show up here and hope something happens.” Instead I saw people who want to make a change, who see the power that something different can bring. People who have worked hard to rearrange things to be here, or have\u0026nbsp;been patient waiting to get to a\u0026nbsp;place in their lives where\u0026nbsp;they could commit to this. \u003Cstrong\u003EAnd I can promise you that while there will be long hours - and hard work as your brains configure to a new way of communicating - if you remember that passion, that focus, that drive that got you here, it will see you through, and become even brighter when you make it to the end.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about the end? I know it’s hard to think about 3 months from now on your first day. But you are going to have a lot of wonderful opportunities here to build two of your most important elements - your network, and your mentors. See, I’m not a “classically trained” developer. I was going to become a nurse, and spent 8 years with the fire department. But my passion for technology never left. You could say that I am “self-taught” - but none of us actually are. The difference is that our teachers aren’t giving us knowledge in classrooms in front of chalkboards. Instead they are the colleagues who tell us our code is great, and suggest improvements to make it greater. The managers who push us to go to a conference. The conference speakers who do the talk, and then chat with us in the hallway for two hours afterwards as we pester them with questions. The forum poster who guides us to cleaner code. And, for you all - your instructors, TAs, and the staff of Smashing Boxes who will work along side of you. I’ve already set an internal goal for myself of spending two hours a week here, and I expect our team will be passionate about working with you all as well. Hold on to those mentors. Always see yourself as an apprentice, learning, growing. But also know that you can easily be that mentor to others - fellow students who don’t understand a problem. Posters on forums you read for answers but whose question you know the answer to. Being a great mentor means being able to be a great apprentice - and you’ll get the chance to do both. Just don’t let Imposter Syndrome get in your way - each of you is super awesome - it’s why you are here! You’ll always have something to teach someone else - and don’t be afraid to try!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing you’ll begin building here is your network. This is point I can’t emphasize enough. Over the years, I’ve built a network of friends and colleagues that have opened so many doors. As I mentioned earlier, I started last week as the CTO at Smashing Boxes, but it came about through a nearly seven month process that started by me reaching out to someone at Smashing Boxes for coffee to see how I could help find people for them. Starting today, you have a network of 45 people you’ve immediately gained, plus your instructors, your TAs, and our staff. We can help you - in fact, we’re here \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;help you - but you can make that even more powerful by purposefully building new connections, having new conversations, and putting yourself\u0026nbsp;in new situations. You may know a general contractor who is looking for web site help. Or an admin assistant who could use a better expense app. Or have friends in the political science space looking for better tools to communicate to the public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause \u003Cstrong\u003Eover the next three months, you will gain a magic power - the power to create.\u003C/strong\u003E It’s a wonderful power, and an addicting power. But the best part is the way it can be used to help others be more awesome at what they do by building things to get stuff that's in their way, out of their way. It will be a lot of work to get there, and sometimes may feel completely overwhelming. When it does, reach out to us. We’ve been there. We understand. We can help you\u0026nbsp;find ways through it. We ultimately want to see all of you succeed because while the world may not need “just more devs” - it can use a group of smart, talented, curious, passionate people who have the power to create things that solve problems for the rest of us.\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"passion-and-curiosity-a-speech-to-code-school-attendees","slug_history":[],"visits":916,"published_at":"2015-02-27T10:00:00.000-05:00","author_name":"","category_id":1,"image_uid":"2015/02/27/10/12/55/668/file","created_at":"2015-02-27T09:05:01.667-05:00","updated_at":"2015-03-02T14:31:31.316-05:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":"passion and curiosity a speech to code school attendees","featured":false},{"id":246,"title":"Introduction to the MEAN Stack [video]","summary":"At Smashing Boxes, we encourage our developers to teach the rest of our team about trending technologies, innovative concepts, and new workflows that they are interested in or testing out.

Social justice just got a whole new tool to play ball. Instead of hauling stacks of paper, community health workers can now use apps with robust images to identify danger signs during the birth of a baby. Farmers can follow the stock market and consider the best time to sell their coffee for a profit.

This allows developers to produce more maintainable code while having fun doing so.\u0026nbsp;Additionally, Swift includes a for-in loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences. The loop can use exclusive and inclusive ranges, and parentheses are optional.

This syntax is another way Swift has successfully increased readability making it very easy to understand what the code does.

In Swift, functions are first-class types. Compare that to Objective-C, where you have methods which must belong to a class.

The first parameter “5″ does not need an external name, because the method name itself sufficiently describes the first variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EIt looks like things will get pretty fun with functions in Swift: currying, variadic arguments, multiple return values.

We still haven’t tested our app on the Watch and there will be many iterations to come to make it perfect. Never-the-less, we’ve learned quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHere’s how we tackled it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGo simple.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe Apple Watch enforces simplicity; it has to be simple to be effective. With the Watch, the user must be able to execute an action or pickup content in a few seconds or it's going to fail. That’s your sniff test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tI approached designing for CRNT as if I were drawing in the sand. When you strip down all of the details and break it into segments that are simple enough to communicate in sand, you’ve hopefully achieved something minimal, functional, and memorable for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA team always beats going it alone.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIt’s important I mention that I didn’t do all of this alone. I had an amazing team of designers, developers, and marketers working alongside me to bring this app to life and then share it with the world. I also had the immense support of our founders, Brian Fischer and Nick Jordan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tEveryone who was part of this project volunteered their expertise and enthusiasm, and CRNT only exists due to their efforts.

Playing with our app on the Watch after release is likely to be a humbling experience. We’ve created a buzzworthy app for a product we’ve never touched.

In order for pictures to appear as expected on LinkedIn we would have to upload an image that meets the LinkedIn thumbnail dimensions of 180 X 110. Considering the small size, inserting an image optimized for LinkedIn might not work well with the rest of the post’s content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe small image problem can be solved with a little tinkering. Once your image is scaled down and inserted into your post, change its width to 1 and the height to 1. Also, add a style of opacity 0 to your image, which will hide it completely. The new width, height, and opacity will ensure there is not a huge chunk of white space within your WordPress post. After publishing your post and sharing the url on LinkedIn, you should have a non pixelated, non stretched image as the thumbnail:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp id=\"attachment_3230\" style=\"width: 518px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smashing-Boxes-Overview-LinkedIn2.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\" wp-image-3230 \" alt=\"LKND Optimized Stealz Image\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smashing-Boxes-Overview-LinkedIn2.png\" width=\"508\" height=\"170\"\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003E\r\n\tAfter applying our first workaround, the thumbnail displays as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tHere’s the code for Solution 1:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Cimg style=\"opacity: 0;\" alt=\"stealz3\" src=\"\u0026lt;a href=\" http:=\"\" placehold.it=\"\" 180x110\"width=\"1\" \"=\"\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://placehold.it/180x110\" width=\"1\" \"=\"\"\u003Ehttp://placehold.it/180x110\"width=\"1\"\u003C/a\u003E height=\"1\" /\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Ch3\u003E\r\nSolution 2\u0026nbsp;(better)\r\n\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhile the first solution works as a quick fix, if you’re a styling perfectionist the previous work around may prove to be a little too hacky. Even though we made the image “disappear”, it’s still in the DOM and may cause more white space between paragraphs than wanted. Fortunately, we discovered a more stable (and intricate) fix which we are using on this very post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOpen Graph and WordPress Meta box\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://ogp.me/\"\u003EThe Open Graph\u003C/a\u003E protocol\u0026nbsp;is a single technology that provides information to represent your webpage. Using Open Graph meta tags allow developers more control over how a piece of shared content is displayed on social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google +, making it handy for cross-platform social strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdding Open Graph to your WordPress theme\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAs noted above, Open Graph tags have to be added within the HEAD tags. So we added the following code to our Header.php file:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"\"/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"\" /\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"\" /\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"\" /\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"\" /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBy looking at the tags we can intuit their meaning: Og:url is the url of the post/page, Og:title is the title of the post or page, Og:description is the description of the content we are presenting, Og:type is the type of content (e.g., “article” or “video”), and Og:image is the url of the image you wish to describe/show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFor a static HTML file we could simply hardcode the content.\u0026nbsp;In other words we could put\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u0026lt;meta property=”og:title” content=”How to implement Open Graph with WordPress“/\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tinto the HEAD of a page and that title will appear when it is shared. Because WordPress pages are dynamic PHP code, that technique does not apply. Instead, the content of the meta tag will depend on the page or post. Using WordPress template tags to dynamically populate the metadata we get the following:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"\u0026lt;?php the_permalink(); ?\u0026gt;\"/\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"\u0026lt;?php the_title(); ?\u0026gt;\"/\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"\u0026lt;?php echo strip_tags(get_the_excerpt($post-\u0026gt;ID)); ?\u0026gt;\" /\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" /\u0026gt;\r\n\u0026lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"\u0026lt;?php echo wp_get_attachment_url(get_post_thumbnail_id($post-\u0026gt;ID)); ?\u0026gt;\" /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe highlighted code tells WordPress, “If I’m on the ‘Home’ page, output the homepage url, title, description, and featured image”, “If I’m on the ‘About’ page, output the data related to the about page.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tFrom now on we’ll focus on the og:image tag since it’s where social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook pull image data from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFeatured Image, to be or not to be?\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe code above retrieves the selected featured image and inserts it into the og:image tag. What if you don’t always want to display a featured image? If you repost every piece of content from your blog onto a social network without selecting a featured image, the result will be no content pulled into the og:image tag. The solution is to always add a featured image with the option to choose whether or not to display it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn order to accomplish the stated goal of providing an option to display or hide the featured image within a post, we first made a meta box. Let’s grab a generic one from the WordPress codex:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E/* Define the custom box */\r\nadd_action( ‘add_meta_boxes’, ‘myplugin_add_custom_box’ );\r\n/* Do something with the data entered */\r\nadd_action( ‘save_post’, ‘myplugin_save_postdata’ );\r\n/* Adds a box to the main column on the Post and Page edit screens */\r\nfunction myplugin_add_custom_box() {\r\n$screens = array( ‘post’);\r\nforeach ($screens as $screen) {\r\nadd_meta_box(\r\n‘myplugin_sectionid’,\r\n__( ‘My Post Section Title’, ‘myplugin_textdomain’ ),\r\n‘myplugin_inner_custom_box’,\r\n$screen\r\n);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n/* When the post is saved, save our custom data */\r\nfunction myplugin_save_postdata( $post_id ) {\r\n// First we need to check if the current user is authorised to do this action.\r\nif ( ‘page’ == $_POST['post_type'] ) {\r\nif ( ! current_user_can( ‘edit_page’, $post_id ) )\r\nreturn;\r\n} else {\r\nif ( ! current_user_can( ‘edit_post’, $post_id ) )\r\nreturn;\r\n}\r\n// Second we need to check if the user intended to change this value.\r\nif ( ! isset( $_POST['myplugin_noncename'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['myplugin_noncename'], plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) ) )\r\nreturn;\r\n// Third we can save the value to the database\r\n//if saving in a custom table, get “”\"”\"”\"”\"”\"post_ID\r\n$post_ID”\"”\"”\"”\"”\"” = $_POST['post_ID'];\r\n//sanitize user input\r\n$mydata = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['myplugin_new_field'] );\r\n// Do something with $mydata\r\n// either using\r\nadd_post_meta($post_ID, ‘_my_meta_value_key’, $mydata, true) or\r\nupdate_post_meta($post_ID, ‘_my_meta_value_key’, $mydata);\r\n}\r\n/* Prints the box content */\r\nfunction myplugin_inner_custom_box( $post ) {\r\n// Use nonce for verification\r\nwp_nonce_field( plugin_basename( __FILE__ ), ‘myplugin_noncename’ );\r\n// The actual fields for data entry\r\n// Use get_post_meta to retrieve an existing value from the database and use the value for the //form\r\n$value = get_post_meta( $_POST['post_ID'], $key = ‘_my_meta_value_key’, $single = true );\r\necho ‘\u0026lt;label for=”myplugin_new_field”\u0026gt;’;\r\n_e(“To Show featured image type, ‘show’ “, ‘myplugin_textdomain’ );\r\necho ‘\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; ‘;\r\necho ‘\u0026lt;input type=”text” id=”myplugin_new_field” name=”myplugin_new_field” value=”‘.esc_attr($value).’” size=”25″ /\u0026gt;’;\r\n}\r\n?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tAfter adding the above sequence to functions.php in your theme, notice you now have a meta box in your posts. Now let’s configure it to give us the option to display or hide the featured image.\u0026nbsp;Notice the code in the red, the \r\n\t\u003Cspan style=\"color: #ff0000;\"\u003E$value \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"color: #000000;\"\u003Eis the variable that points to the content we type in our \u0026nbsp;meta box.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/span\u003EWe can use that value to decide whether or not we want to show the featured image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn your template find where the featured image is displayed. Generally, the image will be in the single.php file of your theme, but it may be in more than one location. For our purposes we just want the option to display or hide the featured image on a single post, which will be the single.php file in your template.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe featured image syntax, once located, will typically look like the following:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u0026lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tNow edit the code to work with the meta box.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u0026lt;?php\r\n//Get the value\r\n$value = get_post_meta(get_the_ID(), $key = ‘_my_meta_value_key’, $single = true );\r\n//If the value is show\r\nif ($value == ‘show’) {\r\n//Show the thumbnail\r\nthe_post_thumbnail();\r\n}\r\n?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\r\n\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe code above retrieves the value of the meta box and if the value is “show”, it will display the featured image. If the “show” text is not in the meta box the featured image will not display, but the image’s information will still be pulled into the og:image tag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe workaround allows WordPress users to display or hide featured images by manipulating the og:image tag. By incorporating Open Graph, users allow social networks to display their featured images as appropriately scaled thumbnails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ESmashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

That was the question Jon Spinney and Sean Steigerwal had on their minds come graduation time from NC State's School of Business.

Getting funding is seen as a necessary evil for startup founders; something you just have to get through. But it’s hard, especially for startups in the local area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe entrepreneurial community in the Triangle is strong. Universities, coworking spaces and young businesses like ourselves are all working to foster the growth of this community. But we still have a ways to go to compete with the country's largest tech hubs. So, how do we get there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tBy raising capital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThe area has seen a lack of capital available for early-stage businesses, which has pushed some to seek out bigger cities a larger venture scene. In my nearly five years in the local startup scene, I have seen many great ideas stall or not grow nearly as large as they could have because of difficulty in raising funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThats a tough pill to swallow for a fellow entrepreneur. There’s nothing worse than when a company that has been founded by North Carolina natives picks up and moves to the West Coast, or cities like Boston, because that’s where the money is. We want to be a successful entrepreneurial hub, so we need to keep these people, and their companies, here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA New Idea Based on a Common Trend\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tIn 2013, Jon and Sean dreamt up the idea for Malartu, a website that would allow investors to pick and choose the startups they fund. They came to us to design and deliver the final product. To best do this, we had casual, informal conversations with local startups and investors. Our biggest takeaway was that these investors invest in their community to grow their community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWith \u003Ca href=\"https://malartufunds.us/preview\"\u003EMalartu\u003C/a\u003E, startups can list their company on the site and certified investors can browse through and choose to invest in a limited number of infant businesses. It allows N.C. startups to raise $50,000 to $1,000,000, and accredited investors can put as little as $1,000 into a company.  Like a traditional crowdfunding initiative, Malartu allows multiple investors to invest in one company, it just doesn’t have to be at the same time or altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FKTanilTICbpMQTUFeBnOcxeMIWlhXuZkF8aA1AHphmOU72u5eIgO3lAjylJIHK-2P-S8-u95mXgISaI_A1GMEIUTM_69tw6_cxSQOD5TrPuZx4FX82N_yWTu-gznZ61M-CYQCw\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"357px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"laptop-a16c8b4d0ee7cb0986646d6c54c67955.png\"\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tEarly adopters to this kind of equity crowdfunding have the power to enable many more startups and thus change the traditional ways capital is raised.

Managing timelines, budgets, and scope creep are obvious aspects of the job, but the difference between good and great project managers can be seen in these skills:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1. The gift of foresight\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tWhat are the risk factors for a project? How can we mitigate them now? How can we communicate them now to set different expectations? These are the questions that every manager should ask at the beginning of the project, and then continuously pose throughout the project process. Accounting for \r\n\t\u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law\"\u003EMurphy’s Law\u003C/a\u003E is a fundamental responsibility of the PM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. The ability to have difficult conversations\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tDelivering bad news clients can be incredibly intimidating, but the ability to identify problems and openly discuss them with stakeholders is a key skill of any project manager. Clients may not be happy about a project item, but they will appreciate knowing the reality of the situation sooner rather than later. Don’t let issues remain undiscussed – bring them up as soon as possible, but offer solid reasoning and alternatives if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Empathy \u0026amp; understanding\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tAside from managing client expectations, project managers are also managing internal teams. Managing people is an inherently difficult task; people have emotional and physical needs – and everyone is motivated in different ways. Getting to know team members personally will help managers understand what makes each person tick. This puts PM’s in a better position to create cohesive teams with knowledge of everyone’s strengths and weaknesses, and better yet create camaraderie that will get the team through difficult situations that arise from difficult conversations – see item #2!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch5\u003E\r\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Knowing when to step back\u003C/strong\u003E\r\n\u003C/h5\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tGetting to know a team’s strengths will help in situations where it’s necessary to admit that the team knows better.  It’s not a manager’s job to know how to program or design (although basic skills are a plus) – but it is necessary to know when to listen to the expertise of the team to guide decision making. In those instances – get out of the way; let the team do what they do best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tNot in a project management role, and wondering how you can get your current manager to build these skills and traits? Talk to them; project managers thrive on communication! Try to phrase the conversation in terms of how you can improve as a team to avoid personal attacks. If you’re noticing build ups to catastrophic project moments that are preventable – start taking the foresight lead in bringing them to your manager’s attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003E\r\n\tIf you’re a junior PM, you can start building these skills at any point during current projects. These habits often come only through learning by mistake or projects gone awry. Check in with yourself periodically to ask what you could have done differently and don’t be afraid to ask your team members for advice on how you can improve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThanks to our wonderful panelists who inspired and informed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1087102\u0026amp;authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK\u0026amp;authToken=HoHm\u0026amp;trk=extra_biz_connect_hb_upphoto\"\u003EJeffrey Donahoe\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1087102\u0026amp;authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK\u0026amp;authToken=HoHm\u0026amp;trk=extra_biz_connect_hb_upphoto\"\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://agencyfirebox.com/\"\u003EKarl Sakas\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=6462683\u0026amp;authType=OPENLINK\u0026amp;authToken=atBI\u0026amp;locale=en_US\u0026amp;srchid=958191911386717318746\u0026amp;srchindex=1\u0026amp;srchtotal=4\u0026amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name\u0026amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A958191911386717318746%2CVSRPtargetId%3A6462683%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary\"\u003EMarc Minor\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4796934\u0026amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH\u0026amp;authToken=RGeQ\u0026amp;locale=en_US\u0026amp;srchid=958191911386717329649\u0026amp;srchindex=1\u0026amp;srchtotal=4\u0026amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name\u0026amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A958191911386717329649%2CVSRPtargetId%3A4796934%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary\"\u003ETera Simon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","slug":"four-tips-for-effective-project-management","slug_history":["more-fun-less-stress-what-you-need-to-know-about-project-management","what-you-need-to-know-about-project-management"],"visits":1930,"published_at":"2013-12-11T05:00:00.000-05:00","author_name":"Carolyn Frazier","category_id":2,"image_uid":"2014/07/21/12/57/41/740/file","created_at":"2014-06-05T14:21:38.598-04:00","updated_at":"2015-06-15T15:24:53.768-04:00","markdown":"","image_alt_text":null,"featured":false},{"id":315,"title":"Building Themes for Spree eCommerce","summary":"Spree is an open-source eCommerce solution built on top of Ruby on Rails.

It is the task of experience designers to identify and improve - or altogether create - these touch points that lead to a positive experience for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tOutside of the digital realm, designed experiences are pervasive; we just don't always notice them. Museums, theatre, music, architecture, amusement parks, and even\u003Ca href=\"http://Close tie between Amsterdam and Prague but I think Prague takes the cake.\"\u003E entire cities\u003C/a\u003E are designed with some degree of intention. The goal may be to connect with people, add greater meaning to their lives, or to foster a sense of affinity for a brand or institution. But do people forging experiences outside of the digital realm go about it in the same way? Or is there a thing or two that we, in the digital world, could learn from them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tThis is what Dante and I were pondering when we came up with the idea of the Experience Smashcast. As a company, our approach embraces technology as a part of the broader customer experience - customer relationships, support, marketing, design - these things all contribute to the larger ecosystem of the user experience. With this in mind, we wanted to see how, why, and with what, others are crafting powerful, human experiences beyond digital. And, from a selfish point of view, we knew we would benefit from understanding different perspectives on experience design, with the hope that those benefits would carry over to our own clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tI can't remember who thought of it first, but Marbles Kids Museum resonated with both of us. Even if you're simply meandering around downtown Raleigh, the architecture of the building is an experience in itself. There's an odd, pointy glass structure where people can walk out over the sidewalk and look out onto the park next door. On the adjacent side stands a tall, purple iron gate with a fountain behind it. And rising high from the roof, a large half sphere of glass windows. Indoors, the architecture is whimsical and inspiring, making you feel like you're a kid again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tSo we reached out. And to our surprise and delight (we weren't sure how seriously people would take our off-the-cuff idea) members of the leadership team\u0026nbsp;were thrilled to talk with us about what goes into creating \"the Marbles experience” and what they’re all about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWe had so many questions for them. We wanted to know about their philosophy and vision, their process, how their process informs their culture. Do they do 'user' research? Do they test prototypes? Where do they draw inspiration and how do they keep themselves fresh? This episode of the Smashcast holds the answers to those questions, but more importantly, it's an inspiration. And not just for experience designers, but for anyone who is a human.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189319575\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026amp;visual=true\"\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\tWhat did you think?
