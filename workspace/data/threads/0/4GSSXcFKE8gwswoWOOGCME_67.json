  "about": "<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. After defeating the hellsnake, as is custom for any Jerseyite who wants to leave, I landed in Medford, Massachusetts, to go to Tufts. I studied computer engineering, did some comedy, and was elected to the student senate ironically. I brought forward a resolution to abolish the senate. A man pointed at me and banged a gavel; it did not go well.<br><br>I moved to Carrboro about a year ago to live with my girlfriend, who's in medical school. We have a cat, Henry, who is very large and likes to party.</p><p>When I'm not working, I like to be honing some kind of skill, be it practicing a foreign language (Tá Gaeilge, Fraincis, agus Béarla agam), drumming, or learning some hot new tech buzzwords.</p>",
