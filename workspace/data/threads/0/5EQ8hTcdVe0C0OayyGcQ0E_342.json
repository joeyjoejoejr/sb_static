  "body": "<p><strong>How is The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes in Durham different from other Iron Yard locations?<br></strong></p><p>Each Iron Yard location is awesome. But ours is unique in that not only will you learn from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy\">world-class instructors</a>, but you’ll have support from an entire company dedicated to growing talented developers. The school represents an equal partnership between&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theironyard.com\">The Iron Yard</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smashing Boxes</a>, marrying credibility and experience with a strong understanding of the local technology landscape. Our location in the entrepreneurial and tech-friendly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.americantobaccohistoricdistrict.com/\">American Tobacco Campus</a>, just minutes from  Research Triangle Park, is optimal for embracing technology and securing an enviable job in tech. You’ll be smack-dab in the middle of one of the hottest tech campuses and start-up cities in the country.</p><p><strong>How much does the Academy cost?</strong></p><p>Dollar for dollar, we offer&nbsp;one of the most affordable coding programs in the United States&nbsp;for the quality and return on investment. Best-in-class instruction and true career support are hard to find (our job placement success rate is 100%, by the way). Additionally, the cost of living in Raleigh/Durham is generally far less than places like New York and San Francisco, making the life transition much more feasible for people in all walks of life. </p><p>Tuition for the cohort beginning January 12, 2015&nbsp;is $12,000. And there's never been a better time to apply as tuition is rising to $12,000 starting with our January 2015 cohort as we introduce several new programs to make our student experience even stronger. We do have financing options and scholarships available, which we’ll discuss in more detail below. </p><p>You’ll also need to purchase a Macbook computer. We’ll give more details below on the specifications required as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you offer financing?</strong></p><p>Yes, after all our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to launch a successful programming career. Explore our financing options below and note that each option requires a $1000 deposit to reserve your space in the class. </p><ul> <li>We are excited to offer financing through a partnership with <a href=\"https://climbcredit.co/\">Climb Credit</a>. Their plan offers 100% financing over a 3-year period. Once accepted to our program, you can apply for approval. Most applications find out if they qualify in the same day. </li><li>We also partner with Upstart, who can help you finance your experience at the Academy. Once you've applied to our program, ask our Campus Director, Jessica Mitsch, about this option during the interview process.</li></ul><p><strong>What scholarships are available and how can I apply? </strong></p><p><em>The&nbsp;Diversity Scholarship&nbsp;</em></p><p>The Diversity Scholarship&nbsp;provides support to women, people of color, military personnel, and people with disabilities.&nbsp;Each scholarship recipient receives a $1000 discount on the total cost of tuition and there is no cap on the number of students per class who can receive support.&nbsp;The application process is simple: we want to know how you'll support diversity by by making technology more open and available to underrepresented groups. (Applicants must be women&mdash;cis or trans, people of color, military personnel or people with disabilities). Apply for the diversity scholarship&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theironyard.typeform.com/to/VtoUdR\">here</a>.</p><p><em>The Smashing Boxes Design Scholarship</em></p><p>Being that we're&nbsp;both a design and development shop, we're always on the lookout for great designers who can code. Anyone with a professional design background who is enrolled in the Front End Engineering course is&nbsp;eligible&nbsp;to apply for the $1500 scholarship. To apply, email your portfolio and resume to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:academy@smashingboxes.com\">academy@smashingboxes.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How will I gain practical experience during the program?</strong></p><p>We teach far more than code, bringing in guest-lecturers who talk about design fundamentals, how to work well with designers, other disciplines of programming, entrepreneurship, product development, and more. We provide our students with the widest possible gamut of exposure so that they have a well-rounded view of the industry when they graduate. </p><p>Our guest lectures from this past cohort included talks from CEOs, CTOs, Developers, Designers, and Product Managers at companies such as:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.healthbytesnyc.com/\">Healthy Bytes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shoeboxed.com/\">Shoeboxed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fugitivelabs.com/\">Fugitive Labs</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.windsorcircle.com/\">Windsor Circle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thestartupfactory.co/\">The Startup Factory</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://validic.com/\">Validic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.spoonflower.com/welcome\">Spoonflower</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">Mozilla</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bronto.com/\">Bronto</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uservoice.com/\">UserVoice</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cognitect.com/\">Cognitect</a>, and of course Smashing Boxes and instructors from other Iron Yard locations. </p><p>In addition to guest lectures, students work on real projects. Whether it’s an internal tool for The Iron Yard or Smashing Boxes, or an actual product we’re building, our students have the chance to work on real stuff that actual customers will use.</p><p><strong>How will you support me to get a career as a programmer?</strong></p><p>Our career support is personalized. Our team works incredibly hard to get students where they want to be, whether that’s a start up or a large corporation. We have contacts all around the country and after the program we meet weekly and communicate as often as needed with each student to execute a job-searching strategy. We also perform mock interviews so that there aren't any surprises when you graduate. </p><p>The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes especially shines in this area due to the nature of The Iron Yard - Smashing Boxes partnership along with our strong Employer Advisory Board. The Board is comprised of companies from various industries across the Triangle region who are interested in hiring Academy students. Additionally, board members provide insight into in-demand skills and emerging technologies and dedicate their time and expertise through guest lecturing and career advising. Our Employer Advisory Board includes:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.anycloud.co/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Any Cloud</a></li><li><a href=\"http://bandwidth.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Bandwidth</a></li><li><a href=\"http://bronto.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Bronto</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.caktusgroup.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Caktus Group</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cognitect.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Cognitect</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.db.com/usa/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Deutsche Bank</a></li><li><a href=\"http://hesketh.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Hesketh.com</a></li><li><a href=\"http://startupreal.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">REAL</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/en\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Red Hat</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.shoeboxed.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Shoeboxed</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.spoonflower.com/welcome\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Spoonflower</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.teamsnap.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Team Snap</a></li><li><a href=\"http://transloc.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Transloc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://validic.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Validic</a></li></ul><p><a href=\"http://www.caktusgroup.com/\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/usa/\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/en\"></a></p><p><strong>What is your success rate in career support and graduates getting job offers?</strong></p><p>The Iron Yard has a 100% success rate across all campuses that have graduated at least one cohort. Students in our current cohort have already started receiving&nbsp;job offers&nbsp;prior to graduation. Want to talk to our graduates? <a href=\"mailto:jessica@theironyard.com\">Email us</a>.</p><p><strong>Didn’t you have an actual job guarantee at one point?</strong></p><p>Yes, we did. And we still would have the actual guarantee were we not seeking to become fully licensed post-secondary educational institutions in every state where we operate. What?? Yeah, seems crazy, doesn't it? You can read the full details <a href=\"http://blog.theironyard.com/post/92054220258/job-placement-program\">in this blog post</a>, but the short story is that in almost all cases state licensing organizations have a rule against using the word \"guarantee\" in messaging, or even implying that placement in a job is promised. That has been a core promise of ours since the beginning because we believe so much in our ability to get people ready for junior level web development roles. We have a proven track record&mdash;we've never had to issue a refund to a student.</p><p>Now to comply with licensing requirements we will be phasing out the language around the job placement \"guarantee\". For new locations launched from today, the job placement guarantee will no longer be part of the offer. Make no mistake: kick-ass career support and job placement will still be our goal, but we can no longer&mdash;by law&mdash;offer a guarantee or promised outcomes.</p><p>We've decided to go above and beyond simply job placement. As we said above, we're working to make our student experience the absolute best in the market, taking you beyond just your first job. </p><p><strong>How do you make all of this happen in only 12&nbsp;weeks?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, we accomplish this through hiring <a href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy\">the most talented people out there</a>. Our employees are some of the most highly-paid people in their industry because they’re extremely accomplished and talented people. But their not just great developers, the people we hire are passionate about changing people’s lives through code education and they invest their heart and soul into making that happen. (Several have left huge companies and promising startups to join our team because they believe in our mission).</p><p>More practically, our program works really well because of our approach to education. We are committed to training the highest quality developers in the world, both in skill and in character. That involves training students to think like engineers and solve problems&mdash;not just how to type the syntax of a language. Knowing syntax and punctuation doesn’t make you a great writer; in the same way simply knowing how to write some JavaScript doesn’t make you a great programmer&mdash;that’s the easy part. Because of this focus on training our students to think like experienced developers, our graduates have an amazing level of aptitude after only 12 weeks with us.</p><p><strong>How much experience do I need to enroll in the academy?</strong></p><p>Technically none, but you’ll have a much easier time if you have some <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/three-ways-to-make-code-school-work-for-you\">prior experience</a>. Here is the breakdown of prior coding experience from a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/durhams-first-code-academy-by-the-numbers\">survey of our first cohort</a>:</p><ul><li>No prior programming experience - 21%</li><li>Minimal experience (e.g. online tutorials) - 32%</li><li>Moderate experience (e.g. took a coding class in school) - 42%</li><li>Extensive (e.g. Bachelor’s degree in CS) - 5%</li></ul><p>If you’re reading this now and want to apply for the upcoming cohort but have no coding experience, don’t fret. Start working through some online tutorials and reach out to us so we can make recommendations on where to start depending on the course you want to take. </p><p><strong>How much time and commitment will it really take?</strong></p><p>We are very clear with our students about how difficult this program is. We train professional programmers, not casual enthusiasts. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/durhams-first-code-academy-by-the-numbers\">survey of our first cohort</a> showed that&nbsp;students spent an average of 80 hours per week on Academy-related work. Many students say the Academy was the most challenging, and equally the most rewarding experience, of their careers. </p><p><strong>What makes it so demanding?</strong> </p><p>You learn a new subject almost every day and have homework associated with that topic due at 8:00am the next day (or Monday if it’s a weekend). The assignments are cumulative, so you incorporate things you’ve already learned into new ones so that by the end you have muscle memory across the spectrum of the subjects you’re studying.</p><p>Don’t get us wrong&mdash;we’re not workaholics and we don’t want you to be either, but building the foundation for a great, balanced career is no easy task. Our policy is “work hard during class so you don’t have to afterwards.”</p><p><strong>What have students said about The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes?</strong></p><p>These quotes come from a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/durhams-first-code-academy-by-the-numbers\">recent survey of the first Durham cohort</a>. </p><p><em>“This program is fantastic...largely due to the exemplary instructors and campus director, and the focus on job placement. My only regret is that this program wasn't available years ago!”</em></p><p><em>“It was the best decision I have made in my career.”</em></p><p><em>“It can be difficult for absolute beginners. I would recommend lots of online tutorials/research before enrolling.”</em></p><p><em>“As a mid-career professional, I had some reservations about taking the risk. It was well worth leaving my full-time position, and I am incredibly encouraged about my future as a developer. The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes promised to provide an adventure and change my life -- they delivered on both. I will be forever grateful.”</em></p><p><em>“Life changing.”</em></p><p>“The collaboration and support were really what made the difference for me. The improvement in my confidence is even more helpful than the improvement in my skills.”</p><p><strong>What kind of computer do I need?</strong></p><p>We require all students to use a Mac laptop (specs below). Why, you ask? There are a few reasons:</p><p>First, all students being on the same platform enables our classes to move much more quickly. Our instructors only have to explain certain things (like setting up new tools) once because workflows apply to everyone. If we allowed students to use different computers with different operating systems, classes simply wouldn't cover as much ground.</p><p>Second, for almost all developers using open-sourced technology, Macs are the tool of choice. Working in a UNIX environment is a huge asset. The open source and web development communities are invested in tools and libraries that work with Apple's OS. In short, using a Mac best prepares our students to work in the development industry.</p><p>Here are the minimum specifications required:</p><ul> <li>Manufacturer: Apple</li><li>Type: Laptop</li><li>Operating system: OS X Mavericks</li><li>RAM: At least 4 GB</li><li>Processor: At least 1.4 Ghz</li><li>HD space: At least 128 GB</li></ul><p>Mavericks is a free upgrade from Apple, so even if your operating system is older you can get the latest and greatest without having to spend any money. Not sure if your machine is compatible? Below is a list of Mac laptops that can run Mavericks. You can also read all of the details about Mavericks compatibility on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/osx/specs/\">Apple's website</a>.</p><ul> <li>MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)</li><li>MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)</li><li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)</li></ul><p><strong>Do you offer housing?</strong></p><p><a href=\"mailto:jessica@theironyard.com\">Email us</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Learn more about The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes at the Academy's website:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://academy.smashingboxes.com\">academy.smashingboxes.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>",
