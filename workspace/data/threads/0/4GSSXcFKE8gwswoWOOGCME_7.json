  "about": "<p>I'm new to the software development game and loving it. Before breaking into the field I was bartending and dabbled in a few other jobs such as selling real estate for a while. I was bored and wanted a normal schedule. A lot of the jobs I was applying for required skills I didn't have so I took a web design certification program which led me to apply and be accepted to a software development bootcamp. I fell in love. It was so exciting to find something I liked to do and that worked really well with how my brain works. I am absolutely having a blast and enjoying learning something new everyday.</p><p>As a recent graduate of a software development bootcamp, professionally I don't have much to speak of...YET. I'm most proud of getting here. It was super scary to quit my job, get rid of my apartment, and pack up a life I built for seven years in Philadelphia with all my friends. Really scary. The bootcamp I had been accepted to was brand new and cost all of my money and then some, quite a gamble; but high risk high reward, right? When I read about the school it said it was going to be bootcamp style and super intense. I completely underestimated what that meant. I have always been able to pick things up quickly so I thought, \"oh yeah I'm sure everyone else will think it's hard but, I got this.\" It was the HARDEST but most rewarding thing I've ever done. I spent easily 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week in school or studying; basically eating, sleeping (I'm not kidding, I had dreams about coding) and breathing code. Now here I am at an awesome company learning from some of the smartest people I've ever met!</p><p>When I’m not working, I’m grabbing life by the ...&nbsp;horns. I love to hula hoop, see live music, travel, adventure, and I am so excited to frolic in the awesome Raleigh weather for my first summer as a resident here!</p>",
