  "about": "<p>I'm a software developer, teacher, and part-time hippie.  In all endeavors, I aim to deliver and appreciate value and quality, whether it 's delivering top-notch software products, appreciating a lovingly cooked meal, or standing in awe at a sunset from a mountain top.</p><p>I'm most proud, not of high profile clients, but of projects I've done that streamline and automate workflows of my coworkers.  I've been lucky to have many opportunities to to help people work better and more happily.  I've implemented a code review procedure, developed internal software to make time tracking easier, and my crowning achievement, built a barcode tracking system that allowed scientists to focus on more important work.  My hope is to be able to bring those improvements in process to more people via quality software.</p><p>I have been a crooner, professional chef, dance instructor, and business owner. I'm an occasional vegan, barefoot walker, and avid beard grower.  I value walkable and sustainable cities, critical thinking, and universal equality.</p>",
