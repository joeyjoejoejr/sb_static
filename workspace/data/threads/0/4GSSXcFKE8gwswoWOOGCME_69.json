  "about": "<p>Hi, I’m <a href=\"http://brandonmathis.me/\">Brandon</a>! Born and raised in here in Raleigh-Durham, I started tinkering with computers before I could even spell. I graduated highschool from Millbrook in Raleigh and received my degree in Computer Science from East Carolina University. North Carolina is in my blood and I’m strongly passionate about fostering a strong tech and startup community in the Triangle.</p><p>I’ve been developing web applications since 2009 and started working for Smashing Boxes in August of 2014. You can often find me at the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/\">Triangle.rb</a> or <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/stacked/\">Stacked</a> meetups that I attend and help organize in my free time. I’m a gamer, foodie, martial-artist, film buff, and technology fanatic. My favorite video game is Metal Gear Solid, my favorite movie is Inception, and my favorite animal is the Octopus.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://brandonmathis.me/\"></a></p>",
