  "body": "<p>\r\n\tEvery marketer knows that to create useful and interesting&nbsp;content is to know your audience. It’s no different with website owners. The number of tools that exist to analyze and track your readers is endless, but most times they force you to go from dashboard to dashboard to manually connect the dots. We’ve already discussed \r\n\t<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/growth-engineering-101-google-analytics-essentials\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics</a>, but what you may not know is how powerful GA Event Tracking and Tag Manager can be.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTracking user interactions is so important to optimizing your site, and event tracking is a digital analyst’s best friend. Events act as bread crumbs to your business goals. There are two categories that events fall into: Micro Conversions and Macro Conversions.\r\n</p>\r\n<center><strong>Some examples of Micro and Macro conversions:</strong></center>\r\n<br>\r\n<center>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<strong>\r\n\t\tMicro Conversions</strong>\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\t<strong>\r\n\t\tMacro Conversions</strong>\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\tContact form pageview &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\tE-commerce sale completion\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\tNewsletter sign up\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\tContact form submission\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\tDownloading a PDF\r\n\t</td>\r\n\t<td>\r\n\t\tMembership sign up\r\n\t</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThough events give amazing insights about your site and whether&nbsp;users are on your path to a goal completion, it requires a developer to make it work. Events have the following components which map directly to elements in the Analytics Reports interface:Micro conversions often lead interest in your company or product, so you shouldn’t only focus on Macro conversions. But if you aren’t tracking Micro conversions, you could miss out on some great data and may not be be able to fully understand your goal paths.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Category&nbsp;(required):&nbsp;</strong>The name you supply for the group of objects you want to track</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Action&nbsp;(required):&nbsp;</strong>Paired with a category, used to define the user interaction taken</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Label&nbsp;(required): </strong>Gives more detail to the action</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Value: (optional): </strong>Associates a value with the event (ex. monetary) </li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Non-Interaction (optional):</strong> Indicates that the event hit will not be used in bounce&nbsp;rate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA developer will have to connect the event with the asset that you would like to track:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<code>&lt;a href=\"#\" id=“Product1” onClick=\" ga(‘send', ‘event’, 'category’, ’action’, ‘label’, value);\"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;</code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere’s a simple example. Let’s say that you would like to track how many times a product PDF is downloaded through a button click. We would have to write a similar line of code to the one above that will give us the information we want in our GA account:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Category&nbsp;(required):</strong>&nbsp;PDF_Downloads</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Action&nbsp;(required): </strong>Click_Download</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Label&nbsp;(required): </strong>Product1_PDF</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>V</strong><strong>alue: (optional):</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<code>&lt;a href=\"#\" id=“Product1” onClick=\" ga(‘send', ‘event’, 'PDF_Downloads’, ’Click_Download’, ‘Product1_PDF’);\"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;</code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow we will be able to see this data and we can answer questions like, “how many times are our PDFs downloaded?” or “Why do we need to spend time creating downloads?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven though event tracking is great, you may be realizing that this is not the quickest way to implement event tracking on your site. It can also be tedious and time-consuming for a developer to have to place pieces of code throughout the site, especially if you have multiple PDFs all with different titles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGoogle also recognized this pain point and created a great tool called Google Tag Manager (GTM) that allows you to quickly and easily implement events for your site. Tag Manager acts as a bridge for site owners to tag important events on their site without help from a developer.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe way GTM has made life easier is that you only have to load a code snippet once. This snippet is called the container. The container needs to be placed in&nbsp;immediately after the opening &lt;body&gt; tag.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEx. of a GTM container:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<code>&lt;!-- Google Tag Manager --&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXX\"\r\n\r\n\theight=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"display:none;visibility:hidden\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;script&gt;(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\r\n\r\n\tnew Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\r\n\r\n\tj=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&amp;l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\r\n\r\n\t'//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\r\n\r\n\t})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;!-- End Google Tag Manager --&gt;\r\n\r\n\t</code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tOnce the container is loaded on your site you will never have to hardcode for an event again! Setting up an event in GTM is similar to the “old way” of event tracking. You still need to identify a category, action, label, value, and non-interaction. You can see in the image below that the same identifiers are used as the example before, but there is something different in the label text box.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NdN2_gBJKX5Tix5kLlDhiS9Pjw0BSVXyrj8dl3fxQqmiwwvTm8xgkvWycKdzTLK9k4rdapS7S2d5OcqHY0KRN_kpYMwzXIcIlZgi8sC4yckweQ7tm7raxbeL4aPaNdYGvg\" width=\"556px;\" height=\"520px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is in the text box is called a macro. This macro will return the id attribute of the element that was clicked. Going back to the example above it will return “Product1”. This makes tagging easier because this one tag will work for every PDF on your site that has an id; just make sure your developer gives each a clear and unique id. You do not have to create a tag for individual PDFs on your site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can learn even more about your website and its users by becoming versed in Google Analytics and taking the&nbsp;\r\n\t<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/tips-for-passing-the-2014-google-analytics-exam\" target=\"_blank\">GAIQ Exam</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t*With \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ross-ozburn/35/654/63a\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Ozburn</a>\r\n</p>",
