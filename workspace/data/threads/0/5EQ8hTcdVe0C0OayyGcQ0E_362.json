Cenduit, the largest Interactive Response Technology (IRT) specialist in the world, recognized their userâ€™s desire for a better system and an opportunity to set a new standard for user experience in their industry. They surveyed their users for feedback and then partnered with our experience design team to revamp their user interface, becoming the first in their industry to offer their customers a sleek and modern IRT system.\r\n\r\nWe were flattered when Cenduit invited us to join them on their [QuickCast Series](http://www.cenduit.com/quickcasts) to discuss the evolution of their IRT system and their experience partnering with us. In the following podcast, we join Cenduit in discussing the rising expectations of technology users, how intelligent UX can help products scale, when it's not smart to go mobile, and the challenges of creating a UI for multiple user types.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/175339784&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n",
