  "about": "<p>I am passionate about taking good ideas and turning them into something great. During my career I have been a programmer, QA tester, technical writer, designer, and have even done sales. This background has been incredibly helpful to me as a Project Manager. It allows me to speak to developers, designers, clients, and other members of my teams in ways we can both understand.</p><p>When I'm not helping our clients bring their ideas to life I spend a lot of time with my wife, our two kids, our dogs and a very aloof cat. I can recite \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\" from memory. I use any leftover time being a huge nerd and organizing my collection of board games, pen and paper role playing games, video games and Lego. And yes, the plural of \"Lego\" is \"Lego\". Occasionally I work out by shooting archery or practicing Krav Maga.</p>",
