  "body": "<p>Back in May, we introduced you to Durham’s <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy\">first code academy</a>: the instructors, the curriculum and the concept. Today we’re proud (and awed) at the hard work the 22 students have put in over the past 12 weeks. They’ll showcase their work to press and potential employers through their final projects this Friday at Demo Day and we can’t wait to see them!</p><p>Students in Durham’s first cohort aren’t just talented though, they’re motivated. Here are some cool facts about Friday’s graduating class:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDgvMTgvMTYvMTgvNDEvNzUvQWNhZGVteV9CeXRoZU51bWJlcnMuZ2lmIl1d/Academy_BytheNumbers.gif?sha=967dcd6f\"></p><p><strong>Cue the Second Batch of Awesome</strong></p><p>And because Julia, Clinton, and Jessica don’t have enough going on (yeah...right), they’re going for round two starting next month. The next cohort will begin classes <strong>September 15</strong> (and yes, you can still <a href=\"http://academy.smashingboxes.com/\">submit an application</a>!) in either Front-end Engineering or Ruby on Rails. </p><p>If you’re one of those ambitious (read: badass) souls who wants to try their hands at learning to code, not only do you have time to apply, you have opportunities to save some money while going to school.
