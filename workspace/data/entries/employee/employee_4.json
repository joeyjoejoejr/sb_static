I love throwing out old paradigms for better, more efficient ones.</p><p>I've been lucky to work on large / complex projects in the past as well as working with other very talented developers. I'm most proud of several personal side-projects I've done in collaboration with friends, and the work I'm doing here at Smashing Boxes.</p><p>My interests include functional programming, GNU/Linux, video games, bass guitar, and music.</p>",
