  "about": "<p>I am a project manager, a Hokie, a spicy food lover, and the youngest of a big Greek family. I love bringing people together, solving problems, and making great things happen. There's no better feeling than working with talented creative people to bring ideas to life.</p><p>I've had the privilege of managing a wide range of accounts from large companies such as Verizon Wireless and Rackspace to small startups and non-profits. I love learning the intricacies of each different industry I get to work with. One thing thats the same across projects is my passion for building relationships with clients and doing whatever it takes to make their vision a reality.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm am all around lover of activities and trying new things. When I'm not in the office you can find me hiking, exploring breweries (preferably ones with board games), cheering on the Durham Bulls or Orioles, at a food truck rodeo, traveling, or re-watching Arrested Development on Netflix.&nbsp;</p>",
