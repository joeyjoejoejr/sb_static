  "about": "<p>Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read about me. My name is <span class=\"il\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;\">Zach</span> and I was born in upstate New York. Soon after moving to North Carolina in the second grade, my family bought its first computer and I’ve been tinkering with them ever since.</p><p>Back in 2007, I earned my bachelor’s in Computer Science from NC State. Afterwards I began building web and hybrid mobile apps for companies like SAS, HH Gregg, and Under Armour. I am an avid learner, devouring all I can find on psychology, business, entrepreneurship, and software craftsmanship. The goal of my work is to write simple, understandable software that creates real value for its users.</p><p>A one-time competitive gamer, I’ve taken up competitive coding like Facebook’s Hacker Cup and Google’s Code Jam as my new outlet. My hobbies include watching NC State sports (go Pack!), reading nonfiction, traveling, and spending time with my better half, Katie, and my neurotic Golden Retriever named Gatsby. We have a cat, too, but he’s a jerk.</p>",
