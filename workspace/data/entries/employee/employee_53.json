  "about": "<p>I'm an accountant at heart who is extremely organized, diligent, and efficient. I have an eye for detail and a keen ability to maximize results with limited resources. I love working with start-ups and/or businesses that are in a high-growth mode. I enjoy managing the financials but more importantly, I enjoy translating financial data into plain English to help business owners make informed decisions. <strong><br></strong></p><p>I've been very fortunate in my career to work with companies who are experiencing growth, change, and disruption, all of which create great opportunities for learning. This has allowed me to expand my knowledge, not just from a financial perspective but an overall operations perspective as well. I enjoy consulting because I'm able to take what I learn at one client and apply it to another.</p><p>Some of my personal interests include cooking, running, and watching my kids play sports. I enjoy being outdoors and love warm weather and sunshine. I am a volunteer at Hospice of Wake County and I enjoy supporting such a wonderful organization. </p>",
