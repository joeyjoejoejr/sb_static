  "about": "<p>I am an aficionado of the web. I make my livelihood from it, but I also believe that it can greatly improve the world and human lives. I write clean, efficient code to solve a problem and love to follow the new technologies and methods that can provide us with new paradigms to solve these problems.</p><p>I recently had the opportunity to build an web app for creating and administering slideshows of photos pulled from Instagram. The app was built to be shown on televisions around a large event and is probably is the most eyes that have ever seen my work. I also was able to use some newer technologies like Node.js that I had been itching to use and explore. Besides my freelance work, before starting at Smashing Boxes I most recently worked on the New STN project at Chemical Abstract Service.</p><p>Outside of internety/development stuff, Iâ€™m a huge fan of the Buffalo Bills. I spend way too much time following every roster move and how off-season practices are going. I also like hip-hop and dark, quiet pubs with a great selection of IPAs. And I also really like pizza. And tacos.</p>",
