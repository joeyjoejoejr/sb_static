  "about": "<p>I am a growth strategist focused on using data-driven insights to make informed decisions. Before I got my start at Smashing Boxes, I was a \"mad woman\" working in the wonderful world of digital advertising on global brands such as Aveda and Cree LED Lighting. In a past life, I was a kick boxer and junior firefighter. When I'm not at the office, you can find me reading, cooking, or traveling (or - more likely - spending time with my three-legged cat).  </p>",
