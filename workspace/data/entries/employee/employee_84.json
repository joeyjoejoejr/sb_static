  "about": "<p>Blame it on my parents, but I grew up in a fairly unstructured artistic household. I painted the kitchen cabinets in the middle of the night when I was four. On my fifth birthday I received a genuine toolbox with real tools, crosscut saw included. I rode bikes down dirt roads without a helmet. I ate cake for breakfast. I maxed out my library card, bossed my siblings around and drew everything. Things haven’t changed much. I trained in art and theater and had several years of designing for the stage as well as museums before I fell into technology as a career. As a product director, I love the collaborative process of making a great something out of nothing. So let's learn something new, ignore the rules, and I’ll bring the cake! </p>",
