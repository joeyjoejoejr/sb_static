  "about": "<p>A life long North Carolina native, I have always had an interest in computers and technology. As a problem solver by nature, my life motto is to learn at least three new things each day and apply it to my work. My work ethic is predominantly a composition of thoughtfulness, dedication, and communication with my team.<br></p><p>I am interested in several areas as a developer, including: web development, game development, and computer security. My background includes obtaining my bachlorâ€™s degree in computer science from East Carolina University, as well as previous experience working as a full stack developer. </p><p>When I am not glued to my computer, I enjoy: exercising, traveling, playing a variety of games (video, board, card games), and going for walks with my dog.</p>",
