  "about": "<p>I’m a Web Developer currently residing in Raleigh, North Carolina, but originally from Winston-Salem just a few minutes down the road. My true passion and dedication lies in simplifying people’s lives via finely-crafted software and creating security conscious applications.</p><p>Over the course of my career, I’ve picked up a wide range of development experience across numerous industries. This has given me the opportunity to learn a lot about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to building environments that are helpful, safe and still push the envelope in usability and design. I also have experience as a systems administrator and business analyst, and have served with big box retail corporations as well as startups, which helps me approach new projects from a variety of vantage points that ensure maximum quality and client satisfaction.</p><p>When I’m not working on side projects, I love catching Arsenal matches with a few friends at a pub, playing soccer, and producing hip-hop beats (I’m a Motown enthusiast). Last but not least, I love animals and couldn’t live without my two German shepherds.</p>",
