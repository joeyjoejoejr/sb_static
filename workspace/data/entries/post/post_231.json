  "Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMeteor.js is a new framework for real-time web applications. Meteor follows a publish/subscribe pattern effectively recreating a local database with just the subset of data the user is allowed to see. This frees the developer to write database queries both on the client and server.\r\n</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo bring everyone up to speed on subscriptions before my demo,&nbsp;we watched&nbsp;Matt Debergalis’ \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpp-8gkPWVE\">video on Meteor.js</a>. The video described how you can subscribe to different channels and make the channels very specific. He also goes into some details about how the security works.\r\n</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn this video I explain how to structure a Meteor.js application for people familiar with MVC frameworks such as Rails. I use the \r\n\t<a href=\"https://github.com/Exygy/minimongoid\">minimongoid package</a> and coffeescript for powerful models and <a href=\"https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router\">Iron Router</a> for routing and controllers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI encourage anyone who is interested in learning more about Meteor.js to watch the demo and feel free to comment on the video if you have any additional questions for Michael.
