The paradigm looks like this:</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/computers.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3020\" alt=\"computers\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/computers.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1000\"></a></p><p>\r\n\tAs software developers, it’s our job to write programs that turn inputs into outputs. We do this by writing algorithms. You can think of an algorithm like a recipe. For example, the algorithm for “outputting” a peanut butter and jelly sandwich works like this:</p><h5>\r\n\t<strong>PB&amp;J Algorithm:</strong>\r\n</h5><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Get two slices of bread (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Get some peanut butter (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Get some jelly (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Get a knife (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Use the knife to get some peanut butter and spread it onto one of the slices of bread</li>\t\r\n<li>Use the knife to get some jelly and spread it on the other piece of bread</li>\t\r\n<li>Take the piece of bread with jelly on it and put it on top of the piece of bread with peanut butter (with the jelly side touching the peanut butter side)</li></ol><p>\r\n\tEasy, right?</p><p>\r\n\tLet’s try something a little more difficult. In the next example we’re going to output a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit from an input measured in degrees Celsius</p><h5>\r\n\t<strong>Fahrenheit to Celsius Algorithm:</strong>\r\n</h5><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Get a temperature in degrees Celsius</li>\t\r\n<li>Subtract 32 from the temperature</li>\t\r\n<li>Multiply the temperature by 5/9</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIt turns out that computers are really good at following instructions. That’s why computers are so great at doing things like:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Storing information</li>\t\r\n<li>Displaying information</li>\t\r\n<li>Finding “needles in haystacks”</li></ul><p>\r\n\tBut what if we were to say, “Computer, is this a good haircut?”</p><h3>Human-based Computation for Haircuts</h3><p>\r\n\tWell as it turns out, there are a handful of approaches that we could use to solve this. We’ll cover a few examples of how we could make a recipe to solve the problem.</p><h5><strong>The Classical Approach</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe first problem that you might notice is that a “good haircut” is difficult to quantify. But if we put our mind to it, we might come up with a list of quantifiable traits that looks something like this:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Hair color</li>\t\r\n<li>Distribution of colors</li>\t\r\n<li>Tightness of edges</li>\t\r\n<li>Evenness</li>\t\r\n<li>Symmetry</li>\t\r\n<li>Amount of split-ends</li>\t\r\n<li>Smoothness of fit to shape of the head</li></ul><p>\r\n\tWe could then write an algorithm that looks like this:</p><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Get a picture of the haircut (i.e., convert the haircut into machine language)</li>\t\r\n<li>Analyze the pixels</li>\t\r\n<li>Quantify all traits as a function of those pixels</li>\t\r\n<li>Calculate a score based on how well the picture meets those traits</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIt may come as no surprise to you that this would be an incredibly difficult algorithm to program, and its accuracy would vary tremendously. As it turns out, computers are not very good at these kinds of tasks, so we scrap this approach and all of its second-cousins.</p><h5><strong>The Deterministic Approach</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tLet’s assume for a second that we have unlimited time and resources. How would we solve the problem then?</p><p>\r\n\tWe could use an algorithm like this:</p><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Ask everyone on Earth whether or not they like the haircut</li>\t\r\n<li>Record their answers as either 1’s (yes), 0’s (don’t know) or -1’s (no)</li>\t\r\n<li>Add all the responses together</li>\t\r\n<li>If the result of this summation is &gt; 0, it’s a good haircut</li>\t\r\n<li>Otherwise, it’s a bad haircut</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIn theory, this algorithm would always return the same result (like our Fahrenheit to Celsius algorithm). But in practice, this algorithm doesn’t work because we don’t have unlimited time and resources.</p><h5><strong>A Probabilistic Approach</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tOK, so this is where the fun begins. Let’s assume that you just got a haircut. You’re not sure what you think of it. But you paid $20, so you’d like to find out whether it is good or not. How would you do it?</p><p>\r\n\tIf you’re like me, you’d start by asking, “Mom, do you like my haircut?” which she would answer with a resounding yes. But just to make sure, you ask someone else and log your results as follows:</p>\r\n<!--\r\n#first-example td, #second-example td{ border:1px solid #CCC; text-align:center; }\r\n--><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><table id=\"first-example\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<colgroup>\r\n<col width=\"*\">\r\n<col width=\"*\">\r\n<col width=\"*\">\r\n</colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td style=\"width: 33%;

This is called a probabilistic algorithm. Unlike the deterministic approach (where we ask everyone), this algorithm may return different results based on who we ask (and in what order we ask them). This is how your brain works. It turns perceptions (inputs) into experiences (outputs), where past experiences affect current perception.</p><p>\r\n\tThis human-based, human-inspired, discrete probabilistic approach is the most accurate and efficient way to solve a consensus task.</p><p>\r\n\tIn a consensus task, the goal is to identify a hidden state of the world by collecting multiple assessments from human workers. (In our example, whether the haircut is good or bad.)</p><p>\r\n\tIn order to solve consensus tasks eﬀectively, the decision making system needs to trade oﬀ the benefit of asking someone new with its immediate cost (in our example, the time and efforts spent asking). Here’s how it works:</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/human-computation1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3088\" alt=\"human-computation\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/human-computation1.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"850\"></a></p><p>\r\n\tThis algorithm can then be generalized to work for any consensus task, which means that with the help of humans, computers can solve even the most elusive computations, leaving only the matter of economics.</p><h3>The Matter of Finding Human Help</h3><p>\r\n\tIn the generalized model of the algorithm, we calculate the marginal utility of hiring another worker (i.e, asking another friend). If the marginal cost of getting another answer outweighs the marginal utility of getting another answer, we terminate the loop and accept our current perception as true.</p><p>\r\n\tWe could then use this calculation to create a market with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which has no minimum wage laws:</p><blockquote style=\"font-size: 13px; margin-left: 40px; padding-top: 10px;\">\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tPooling judgments across all 7 (image labeling) tasks we ﬁnd that on average it requires only 4 non-expert annotations per example to achieve the equivalent ITA as a single expert annotator. Given that we paid US $2.00 in order to collect the 7000 non-expert annotations, we may interpret our rate of 3500 non-expert labels per USD as at least 875 expert-equivalent labels per USD.<br>\r\n&mdash;\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/amt.pdf\">http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/amt.pdf</a>\r\n\t</p></blockquote><p>\r\n\tAnd while bypassing minimum wage is cool, what’s cooler is to bypass wage entirely.</p><p>\r\n\tLuis von Ahn, inventor of reCAPTCHA, Games With A Purpose, and Duolingo &mdash; and father of Human Computation &mdash; has mastered the art of free labor.

So let’s consider a few practical applications.</p><h5><strong>Galaxy Zoo</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://sdss.org\">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> used advances in imaging technology to collect pictures of millions of galaxies. The end result of the survey was a data set bigger than anything we had ever collected. Now imagine you’re a graduate student in astronomy. As part of your PhD, you are put to the task of classifying as much of the collected data as possible. (Someone’s got to do it and machines aren’t accurate enough). If you don’t sleep, you might be able to classify 10,000 galaxies per year. If we assume that there are one million objects to be classified, this would equate to 100 PhD man-years.</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://galaxyzoo.org\">GalaxyZoo</a> is a project that set out to solve this problem. The premise is simple. They ask regular folks like you and me to classify galaxies into either ellipses or spirals. With so many galaxies, you might expect that it would take years for visitors of the site to work through them all, but within 24 hours of launch they were receiving almost 70,000 classifications per hour. By the end of it’s first year, more than 50 million classifications were received, contributed by more than 150,000 people. That means that each galaxy was seen by ~50 participants. And since one expert can be replaced by a number of non-experts, they were able to increase the level of accuracy in a fraction of the time.</p><h5><strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tHave you ever seen these squiggly characters when you fill out a form online?</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/recaptcha-example.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3052 aligncenter\" alt=\"recaptcha-example\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/recaptcha-example.gif\" width=\"314\" height=\"125\"></a></p><p>\r\n\treCAPTCHA is actually a way of using human computation to teach computers how to read while providing security against spammers.

Well the computer is relatively certain that it knows the word “upon”, and the word “between” is unknown. &nbsp;Thus, we have a consensus task of revealing what the word that we recognize as “between” actually is (e.g., good or bad haircut?). If enough people agree that the word is “between” the program stops asking and assumes that the word is, in fact, “between”.</p><p>\r\n\tBecause so many people use reCAPTCHA (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) &mdash; the program was able to translate the entire New York Times archive in a few months &mdash; (less than) one word at a time.</p><h3>Our Clients</h3><h5><strong>Dognition: Artificial Canine Intelligence</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tCan you name this man?</p><p>\r\n\t<img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://secularright.org/SR/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/B.-F.-Skinner.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"327\"></p><p>\r\n\tIf you said BF Skinner, give yourself a repeated slap in the face.</p><p>\r\n\tSkinner was psychology’s original pessimist.
