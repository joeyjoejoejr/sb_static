What about Detroit? Paris? Cities carry with them feelings about people and businesses, visions of landmarks, or a subtle taste of a certain kind of food. There’s even a legitimate communications theory based on this idea. <a href=\"http://masscommtheory.com/theory-overviews/framing-theory/\">The Framing Theory</a> suggests that people have certain perceptions about places based on what they’ve heard or seen from media, not from actual experience. Enveloping all of these perceptions and emotions is a city’s brand. And for anyone who lives outside of that city, the brand can have a significant impact on the way they feel about it, whether they would visit, do business, or even move there.</p><p>But branding goes deeper than an image. With the world as globalized and networked as it is, every city has to compete for tourists, investment, capital, business, attention, and even respect. How cities communicate their soul and success is crucial for deciding which ones succeed and which ones fail in the rivalry for economic prosperity. In this sense, cities are like companies. Those with a strong and powerful brand have an easier time selling their products and services that are attractive to people and investors. As the city of Raleigh expands and looks to enhance its domestic image, the idea of branding plays a key role in its reputation and perception.</p><p>With the recent “<a href=\"http://www.wral.com/raleigh-has-a-new-long-term-vision-in-mind-for-downtown/13978245/\">Downtown Experience Plan</a>” put into action to reinvent certain parts of downtown Raleigh, I wanted to revisit some prior work done by our own designer, Raleigh Felton, for the exact purpose of rebranding and drawing attraction to a city. Earlier this year, creative agency <a href=\"http://www.baldwinand.com/\">Baldwin&amp;</a> masterminded the <a href=\"http://instagram.com/rebrandraleigh\">Rebrand Raleigh Instagram account</a> in an effort to create a fresh brand for the City of Oaks. The account is owned by each designer for two weeks, in which they rediscover what Raleigh means to them through the medium of art and illustration. After two weeks, the account is passed to the next audacious designer. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>This is the story of Felton’s journey in designing a brand for the city of Raleigh and what it means for all cities seeking out a brand strong enough to carry them into the future:</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspiration&nbsp;and Discovery</h3><h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The juxtaposition of old and new leaves a striking impression on those visiting Raleigh for the first time. There’s no doubt it is still a city in transition. Aged, brick buildings along the main street sit in the shadows of glass towers. A rustic-chic coffee shop serving brunch to a fashionable crowd looks out to a grimy, dark bus station. There is both a blending of cultures and eras; and a separation.</span></p></h3><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/myFAygCYO7/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5044\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY1-iamraleigh.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><p>Felton began by exploring this separation through design, melding the old and historic with the new and energetic. A city’s brand must be a reflection of the energy, diversity, and individualism of people that give a city it’s unique vibe. The individuality of each person is what makes a city like Raleigh so great.&nbsp;</p><h3>Gaining Perspective</h3><h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Inspiration comes from observing a subject from various angles and perspectives. The art and the textures of cities are startling when you begin to see out the details. In Raleigh, Felton discovered a blending and balance of dissimilar surfaces, textures, and the interlacing of old and new.</span></p></h3><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m0uNh4CYPI/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5045\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY2-intial_thoughts.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m3Wdc7CYD1/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5048\" title=\"Raleigh, North Carolina Photography Rebrand Raleigh\" alt=\"Raleigh, North Carolina Photography Rebrand Raleigh\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY3.1-photos.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></strong><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><h3>\r\nDesign Elements\r\n</h3><p>Color, patterns, angles, shapes: Each must be carefully selected to reflect the movement and emotion of a city. Together they craft that elusive ‘contemporary symbol’. Is there a pattern that can speak a city in its entirety? Different angles, shapes, and colors represent the individuality of people, businesses, cultures, ideas, and areas. In Raleigh, they all come together to make the city we love.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m8ePznCYDD/\"><img class=\" wp-image-5051 aligncenter\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Logo Exploration\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY6-exploration1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m5YPl1CYLD/\"><img class=\"wp-image-5050 aligncenter\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Color Exploration \" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY4.1-color.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m742AfCYAF/\"><img class=\"wp-image-5047 aligncenter\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Pattern Exploration\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY5-pattern.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></a></p><h3>\r\nReal-world Application\r\n</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><p>Inevitably, these metaphors and impressions must translate to a brand that will function in real life. Great designers know that everything should be crafted with purpose. A logo can have beautiful form and extract feeling from its viewer, yet it still has to fit into context and serve its underlying purpose. Here, Felton applies his designs to various city commodities and institutions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/rebrandraleigh\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5054\" alt=\"DAY8-aplications\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY8-aplications.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width:600px;\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/nL2HpWiYBa/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5059\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY13-all.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/nLei2SCYOV/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5058\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY12-image.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></p><h3>What Brands Mean for Cities</h3><h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">A strong brand encompass the meaning of an idea or purpose of an institution, and expresses it to all that view its simple, solitary image. By nature, logos and designs are an evolution. As the institution or idea they represent changes over time, so must they. And as the city of Raleigh continues to shift and grow with each new face, business, and idea, so will the logos, designs, and words that attempt to capture it. The same can be applied to every city. The brand of a place reflects the soul of its inhabitants.</span></p><p>View more of Raleigh Felton’s branding and design work <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/work\">here</a>.</p></h3><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/nD6Eq-CYAP/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5042\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Logo System\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY7.1-Logo-System.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></p>",
