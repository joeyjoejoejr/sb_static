  "Body": "<p>\r\n\tEarlier this year, Smashing Boxes'&nbsp;<a href=\"/bio/leonel-galan\">Leonel Galan</a>, Back-end Developer, started perusing the internet to find volunteering and community outreach opportunities. He came across \r\n\t<a href=\"http://railsgirls.com/\">Rails Girls</a>. Rails Girls originally started in Helsinki, Finland but is now a global non-profit volunteer community encouraging women to enter the development world. They accomplish this by enabling volunteers from around the world to setup an event and teach women to program using Ruby on Rails.<a href=\"http://railsgirls.com/\"><img class=\" wp-image-4019 alignright\" alt=\"rails_girls\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rails_girls.png\" width=\"210\" height=\"172\"></a></p><p>As a Ruby enthusiast, Leonel saw this as the perfect opportunity for him to give back to the community. He was surprised that Charlotte, NC had beaten the Triangle in orchestrating a Rails Girls event, and reached out to Smashing Boxes’ CEO,&nbsp;<a href=\"/bio/nick-jordan\">Nick Jordan</a>, to ask him to sponsor the event and secure venue space in the American Underground classroom. Once that groundwork was laid, Leonel raised awareness about the event, reaching out to two local meetup groups: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-RDU/\">Girl Develop It RDU</a> (that promotes women in technology) and the Triangle Ruby Brigade (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/\">Triangle.rb</a>). Additionally, he contacted the Computer Science departments at NC State University and UNC-Chapel Hill, utilizing their Facebook and Twitter channels.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Untitled.jpg\" style=\"text-align: center; background-color: initial;\"><img class=\" wp-image-4023 \" alt=\"Untitled\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Untitled.jpg\" width=\"207\" height=\"206\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Leonel Galan</p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"></p><p>\r\n\tThe Rails Girls Raleigh-Durham event ran from September 27\r\n\t<sup>th</sup> – 28<sup>th</sup>. Demonstrating the need for the event, there were 81 applications accepted, and 23 individuals chosen for the two-day Ruby on Rails crash course. Eight volunteers came forward to offer their time in teaching, achieving the Rails Girls’ desired teaching ratio of 3:1.</p><p>\r\n\tThe Rails Girls group was comprised of both local university students and adults; priority was given to those who had little or no development experience. On Friday night, the Installation Party set up the development environment on the women’s personal laptops and showed inspirational videos. All day Saturday, there were coding sessions with intermittent five-minute “Lightning Talks” with stories by development professionals &nbsp;discussing why they enjoyed the world of development. The 23 women created their own Twitter-like application using Ruby on Rails, quickly consuming the information and finishing their projects by lunchtime. The enthusiasts began adding extra functionalities to their applications in which the coaches were happy to cure their curiosity.</p><p>\r\n\tThe event received such positive feedback that Leonel intends to plan similar events in the future for the Triangle community, with varying levels of Ruby on Rails training. Through the process of planning for Rails Girls, he has realized the significant network of other talented developers in the area who were steadfastly willing to volunteer their time to educate others. He looks forward to engaging with these individuals as he plans future community developer learning events. \r\n\t<strong></strong></p><p>\r\n\tAt Smashing Boxes, we believe it is important to foster education and learning. Therefore, we wanted to share the most common development languages while encouraging women to be exposed to coding, a skill that allows women to springboard their careers. We are excited to see a member of our team taking an active role in this space.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.
