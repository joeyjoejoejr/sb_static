  "About": "<p>I am a humble, human-centered designer on a journey to explore and contribute my talents to the fields of design. My skills aid in the development of services that are progressive toward the success of service providers and their users. I am extremely intrigued with human experiences and their interactions with the world around them. I believe it is necessary to be an all around designer that creates value by placing people at the center of technology and business strategy. I challenge myself to be a problem solver by way of design innovation, user-centered strategy, and holistic thinking.</p><p>During my college experience at SCAD&nbsp;I had wonderful opportunities to work with great clients in Savannah, Georgia. The most gratifying being a project with Goodwill Industries of the Coastal Empire. This was a social innovation project that actually came to life soon after delivering our solutions to the client. We created a service that would greatly increase the amount of donations in which, collecting donations is at the heart of this non-profit organization. Other projects that I am proud of involve companies such as Perc Coffee, SCAD Service Design Department, and The National Park Service.</p><p>I find much joy creating memories, sharing jokes, and having long, encouraging talks with my loved-ones. I also love to cook whether, it is a quick breakfast or three-course dinner. Cooking is my number one stress reliever. While cooking, I get a chance to take one thing at a time and step-by-step create something that brings delight to all those who are around me. Finally, I enjoy shopping, I love comparing products, reading labels, and scrolling through product reviews.</p>",
