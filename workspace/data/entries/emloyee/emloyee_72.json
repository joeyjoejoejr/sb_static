  "About": "<p>I’m a creative and strategic thinker, a challenge seeker, an anthropologist, and people person to the max. I get my kicks meeting new people, making introductions, and creating opportunity. I believe business should be approached with a generous and collaborative spirit. The big payoff is seeing great ideas and bright people succeed.</p><p>I have forged an unconventional career path driven by irresistible challenges and unquenchable curiosity. I’ve developed successful PR, content, and launch strategies for a wide variety of brands spanning an even wider variety of industries: tech, advertising, music, education, non-profits, tourism and food &amp; beverage to name a few. I’ve had a thriving freelance business of almost 10 years — that is perhaps my proudest and hardest won achievement of all.</p><p>Talking and laughing top the list of my favorite pastimes - if there's a cup of coffee or a glass of wine involved, even better. I'm a passionate bike commuter (in heels no less!) and alternative transit enthusiast. I get my mountain fix whenever possible, preferably in my home states of Montana and Oregon. </p>",
