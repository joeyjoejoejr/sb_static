  "About": "<p>I’m a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and have been living in North Carolina for ten years. I spent two years working in the corporate world as a back-end Java developer. I’ve switched gears and am diving into the wide world of Android development. I’m glad to be a part of the exciting culture of innovation and learning here at Smashing Boxes.</p><p>As a child of British transplants, I’ve had a lifelong love of all things British and a special admiration for the Royal Family. I’m also a Francophile, having majored in French alongside Computer Science at college. I was even lucky enough to study abroad in Paris. In my spare time I enjoy learning new languages, reading dystopian novels, and arguing about grammar.</p>",
