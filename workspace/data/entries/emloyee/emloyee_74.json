  "About": "<p>I'm a Rails developer, having fled from Big Cubicle a few years ago. I love harnessing technology to solve problems&nbsp;big and small, and bringing an idea to life in the form of an application. I get excited about code education;&nbsp;creating a better path for people looking for a better way to spend a work day.</p><p>I've been lucky to work for great clients and companies, including CodeSchool.com, Summit Church of Orlando, Aloompa, and Caterpillar/Mike Rowe.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm an avid fan of sports car racing, UCF, and the Broncos. I'm a fair-weather Rockies &amp; Magic fan, and I'll watch almost any college football game that pops up on TV. I love traveling, national parks, and ski trips, but being at home with my wife and preschool boy is great, too.</p>",
