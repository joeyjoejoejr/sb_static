  "About": "<p>I have a huge appreciation for creativity, details and all things organized. I love being inspired by what's around me and being able to create new things. I think this is why I pursued my undergrad in both Business Administration and Design. Some day, I would love to be a creative director. Until then, I want to continue to learn and push the limits, strengthening my skill set as a project manager.&nbsp;</p><p>I started my career in project management at Lenovo. Initially I was a project manager intern, tackling on a broad set of projects. From editing banners in Photoshop to QA regression testing for Lenovo.com... I did pretty much whatever was thrown at me. Months later, I became a full-time project manager on their web team. This experience has truly been valuable to me, because I discovered that the skills it takes to be an effective project manager really align with my strengths.</p><p>I love good food, any music and spending time at the beach. I try to stay active, I love kickboxing and yoga... pretty much anything that will keep me away from my Netflix account (in which I spend entirely too much time on). </p>",
