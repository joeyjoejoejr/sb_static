  "About": "<p>I have a PhD in bioinformatics and computational biology. I&nbsp;wanted to learn the business side of things for when I start a company someday, so enrolled in business school at UNC-Kenan Flagler. I am an analytical thinker who loves technology and making a difference in what I do every day.&nbsp;</p><p>I used to conduct research on breast cancer and studied protein kinase gene networks. Towards the end of grad school, I spent some time helping my advisor launch a medical diagnostic device, which was how I became interested in business, entrepreneurship, and startups.&nbsp;</p><p>My interests include technology, food, startups, entrepreneurship, microbreweries, and being outdoors.</p>",
