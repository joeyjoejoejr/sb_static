  "About": "<p>I am a creative thinker and problem solver interested in creating flawless experiences for human beings. I enjoy converting information into understanding by any means necessary. I think in systems, I speak in technical jargon, and most of my dreams are namespaced. My ideas are modular; maintainable; scalable. I'm going to visualize all of the data. I'm here to build things.</p><p>My computer science coursework at N.C. State exposed me to low-level concepts and gave me the tools to reason about computer systems. During that time I was managing editor of the student paper, a DJ on the student radio station and webmaster/admin to countless experiments, freelance projects and hacks. Since then I have been in deep meditation in a remote mountain stronghold, studying the ways of the DOM and waiting for HTTP/2.</p><p>I'm deeply interested in music and instruments from all corners. I build and ride longboards when the weather is nice. I can't whistle but I once bearded an opponent to death.</p>",
