  "About": "<p>I love HR - because I love people. Humans are a company's greatest resource. I believe each person is unique and different. I am passionate about learning and understanding from a cultural perspective how to inspire and engage employees.</p><p>Prior to joining Smashing Boxes, I was a character at Disney World, an intern with USA TODAY and an employee engagement consultant with a company called The Fun Dept. I believe that great vision without great people is irrelevant.</p><p>I enjoy hiking, thrifting, enjoying familiar places and exploring new places, yoga, eating delicious healthy foods, and pick-up soccer games. I am also really proud of my handshake.</p>",
