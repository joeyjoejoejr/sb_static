  "About": "<p>I'm a luddite who's grudgingly accepted that Internet and mobile technology are here to stay. It's my purpose to make that technology work for us and enhance our humanity, rather than forcing us to let go of who we are in a never-ending quest for greater productivity, efficiency, and information throughput. I am a man, not a machine, and I design tools that serve other human beings.</p><p>I'm proud of my contribution to everything I've worked on.</p><p>My personal interests include my family, my dogs, hockey, professional wrestling, and the woods.</p>",
