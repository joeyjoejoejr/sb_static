  "About": "<p>I'm a project manager, which means I thrive on multi-tasking, love communicating, and feel a certain zen when making a new spreadsheet. I really enjoy translating business needs into technical speak for developers, and helping articulate agency speak back to clients to keep us all on the same page. The relationships that I get to build with clients, and with our internal teams are really satisfying, especially when we all achieve a big milestone together.<strong><br></strong></p><p>I've been lucky enough to work with a variety of clients over the last few years â€“ from blue collar business owners looking to create a presence on the web, to big established names like Duke University, PPD, and the YMCA of the Triangle. Learning each client's industry and unique challenges is one of the most interesting parts of my job.</p><p>I'm our office's resident crazy cat lady and I'm not ashamed! I love getting outdoors, particularly back to the mountains to visit my alma mater - Appalachian State. I also garden, rock climb, bike, and try to attend as many concerts as I can. Don't be fooled by that action packed sentence though; I log a lot of time on Netflix. I'm a total documentary junkie when I'm not re-watching old episodes 30 Rock.</p>",
