  "About": "<p>I've been called Mr. President, Hambone, Lt. Liberty, Steve Rogers, and DJ Hamm. I have a scar on my leg from where I stabbed myself with a sword when I was nine, I own about 350 books since I hope to have my own library one day, I have a video on YouTube with 165,000 views, and I can name all 44 presidents in 44 seconds. </p><p>When I’m not treating my code to some Marvin Gaye and chardonnay, I can be found doing one of two things: </p><p>1. Re-­reading the Declaration of Independence whilst listening to Bonnie Raitt whom I will marry.</p><p>2. Coming up with sentences that use whilst and whom.</p><p>“Two chains!” ­ 2 Chainz</p>",
