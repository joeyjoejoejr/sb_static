  "About": "<p>I am rational optimist motivated by new challenges. I’m not the typical person you’d find at a tech company&mdash;I studied history and spanish as an undergrad and later got my Master's in Public Health at UNC-Chapel Hill. These degrees honed the critical thinking and communication skills I use every day as a Product Director. In my life before Smashing Boxes I worked for small NGOs, on global health projects around the world, and with a large government contractor. These various career experiences allow me to understand and empathize with any client.</p><p>I want to push the envelope to integrate technology with healthcare domestically and abroad. It’s a major effort,&nbsp;but I’m excited about the possibilities. I see my work at Smashing Boxes like an adult version of Odyssey of the Mind, a creative problem-solving competition I loved in middle school.</p><p>Some of my personal interests are cooking, hosting events and parties, rock climbing, hiking, traveling to obscure places, and spending time with my awesome husband.</p>",
