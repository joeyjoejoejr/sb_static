  "About": "<p>I am an interaction designer and information architect with a passion for solving design problems both large and small. I am immensely grateful for every day I have a chance to spend working to help people achieve their goals through design.</p><p>I got my start as a graphic designer working on editorial design for The Food Network Magazine. This experience serves as a guiding foundation in my current work as a user experience designer. Before coming to Smashing Boxes I was fortunate enough to do interaction and visual design in Washington, D.C. for a number of inspiring non-profit organizations including The National Brain Tumor Society, Greater Than AIDS, The Kaiser Family Foundation, Global Zero, and more.</p><p>My personal interests include everything even remotely related to information, interaction, and visual design, as well as backpacking, hiking, and playing ice hockey.</p>",
