  "About": "<p>From day one I was taking apart computers. On day two I began drawing. Combine the two and what do you get? A Front End Developer. I am a fashion forward front end developer with a love of digital art (css), having more shoes than a girl, and traveling. Clients donâ€™t always see my code but I have pride in writing the cleanest, neatest, most powerful code I can achieve. Did I mention I love shoes?</p><p>Due to Smashing Boxes diverse clientele, I have worked on a number of awesome projects ranging from building products that help those less fortunate in Africa to developing learning tools that help children progress through their life at school.</p><p>My personal interests are music and traveling. Nothing is better than riding on a train through Europe listening to the trips soundtrack I set up weeks before my plane departed. I also like surfing, laughing, and trying new things.</p>",
