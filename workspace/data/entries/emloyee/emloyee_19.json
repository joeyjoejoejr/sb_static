  "About": "<p>I’m a pretty energetic, positive person and I’d like to think I carry that over to my professional life as well. Ever since I can remember I’ve loved mathematics, physics, and technology, so for me studying Computer Engineering was a pretty obvious next step in life. Now working as a software developer I enjoy trying to solve programming challenges; to me they’re sort of like puzzles and it feels amazing to solve one. I’m always trying to better myself both mentally and physically. Some huge passions of mine are playing instruments, singing, CrossFit, drawing, and playing sports.</p><p>I'm really grateful for having had the opportunity to mainly work with startups and smaller companies. The fast-paced, exciting atmosphere has made work not feel so much like work, but most importantly, it has enabled me to branch out and learn multiple different skills. I've worked extensively with back-end development in the past and one of the better known clients I've worked with has been the YMCA of the Triangle.</p>",
