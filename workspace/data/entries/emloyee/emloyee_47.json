  "About": "<p>The mobile platform has opened up a whole new field of computing and we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible. I love to explore and to learn things. I find graphics programming fascinating, I count it a good day if I get to write some bash, and I have an interest in assistive technologies.</p><p>I’m proud of my iPhone/iPad app, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.storyskeleton.com\">StorySkeleton</a>. The app has been pretty well received in the fiction writing niche.&nbsp;Also, an app I developed at Mirada Studios called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mirada.com/stories/mirrorworld\">Mirror World</a> won a Silver Lion at Cannes 2013.</p><p>I enjoy vim and the delta blues.</p>",
