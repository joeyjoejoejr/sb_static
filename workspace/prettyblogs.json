The first thing most people envision when they think of email is the client, or user-facing application for checking email.</p><h3>Email clients</h3><p>\r\n\tMost people have their favorite way to access email, which may dictate the client from the start. If you prefer Gmail for example, <a title=\"Google Apps\" href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Apps for Business</a> has always been a good choice and was free for small organizations until recently. <a title=\"Google Blog\" href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2012/12/changes-to-google-apps-for-businesses.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google&nbsp;Apps just switched</a> to a paid-only business model which may be a good thing for those who want quality service above all. Their service is now $50 per user, per year and comes with 5GB of storage, which is not a bad deal considering the importance of email. If having the best email experience in a web interface is your concern, Google is the leader.</p><p id=\"attachment_2218\" style=\"width: 310px; text-align: center;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2218 \" alt=\"Gmail\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gmail-300x191.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\"></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\tGoogle Apps</p><h3>Web or Desktop</h3><p>\r\n\tIf Google rules the web client arena, what other choices are worth considering? Fortunately,there are a multitude of other web clients including a few&nbsp;<a title=\"Roundcube\" href=\"http://roundcube.net/\" target=\"_blank\">open</a> source <a title=\"Zimbra\" href=\"http://www.zimbra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">choices</a>. Unfortunately, none of the alternatives have proven very competitive with Google, which provides both the email service and the web client. Additionally, Google allows plenty of integration with services such as documents, Google+, and of course the Android mobile OS.</p><p>\r\n\tIf access from a web browser is not so important, there are some excellent desktop clients. <a title=\"Thunderbird\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/\" target=\"_blank\">Thunderbird</a> is a great open source choice available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Windows users may be used to Outlook and Mac users may choose the built-in <a title=\"Mail app\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/mail/\" target=\"_blank\">Mail</a> app. All of these web and desktop clients except Gmail will require an email server.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2221 \" alt=\"Thunderbird\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/thunderbird-300x211.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\tThunderbird</p><h3>Email servers</h3><p>\r\n\tDespite its humble appearance, email is a complex, decentralized Internet protocol that requires more effort than most businesses are willing to put in to maintain their own private servers. Often, the only method for small to medium-sized businesses to find an email provider is similar to how an individual would find an Internet service provider (ISP) for access to the Web. Other than Google Apps, an email service that includes a web client, what choices are there? Well, there are many free or inexpensive options, most of which are traditional email hosts such as Yahoo!, Gmail, Hotmail, or even your ISP\u2019s included email service. These options are usually not suitable for businesses that care about reliability and premium support options. For more professional service there is <a title=\"FastMail\" href=\"https://www.fastmail.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">FastMail</a>, <a title=\"Rackspace email\" href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/\" target=\"_blank\">Rackspace Email</a>, and again, Google Apps. If you are really adventurous, you could look into hosting your own email service using <a title=\"Postfix\" href=\"http://www.postfix.org/\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> of the <a title=\"Sendmail\" href=\"http://www.sendmail.com/sm/open_source/\" target=\"_blank\">popular</a> open source <a title=\"qmail\" href=\"http://www.qmail.org/\" target=\"_blank\">servers</a>. But having an email client and server is still not the end of the story for many business.</p><h3>Email-enabled apps</h3><p>\r\n\tOk, so you set up your business email using your favorite client. But now you want your web or mobile application to send emails to users when they forget their password or to notify them about a new feature. Can\u2019t you just use the email server you\u2019re already paying for? Unfortunately, typical email services don\u2019t interface well with web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. The reason is that Rails servers are busy serving up web pages or mobile app calls. At the very least, a Rails app would need to create a background job to handle the email delivery. But what if the job fails? Rails does not automatically resend failed messages. So you\u2019re suddenly talking about building a lot of email-related infrastructure around your web app, just to handle email delivery. Luckily, there are great solutions out there for email delivery.</p><p>\r\n\t<a title=\"Sendgrid\" href=\"http://sendgrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sendgrid</a>, <a title=\"Mailgun\" href=\"http://www.mailgun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mailgun</a>, <a title=\"Postmarkapp\" href=\"http://postmarkapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Postmarkapp</a>, and <a title=\"AWS SES\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ses/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a> are all notable email delivery services. These services complete much of the heavy lifting involved with reliable email delivery for you. Their capabilities include things like email signing, making sure server IP addresses are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist#Email_whitelists\" target=\"_blank\">white-listed</a> by spam filters, and monitoring deliveries.</p><h3>Sendgrid</h3><p>\r\n\tSendgrid has been around the longest of the bunch. Founded way back in 2009 it delivers email for large sites such as Quora. Currently, $80 per month with Sendgrid secures a package that includes custom DKIM signing (allowing you to send <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail\" target=\"_blank\">verified emails</a> from your domain). It has an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\">SMTP</a> interface for traditional clients as well as a Web API for modern apps. Sendgrid also has a few unique features like delivery tracking and reputation monitoring.</p><h3>Mailgun</h3><p>\r\n\tMailgun provides a similar service to Sendgrid for $59 per month. Sendgrid\u2019s $80 package advertises multiple IP addresses while Mailgun\u2019s $59 plan states it uses dedicated IP addresses. It\u2019s hard to say which is better and both companies seem to have good domain experience in the field of email delivery. Smashing Boxes has used both Sendgrid and Mailgun for projects and I would say they are quite comparable, although I slightly prefer Mailgun because it seems more developer friendly. Specifically, Mailgun\u2019s documentation has examples in multiple programming languages for all of their API.</p><h3>Amazon Simple Email Service</h3><p>\r\n\tA relative newcomer, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) was introduced at the beginning of 2011. It is strictly a pay-as-you-go service. The prices are affordable at $0.10 per thousand messages and $0.12 per gigabyte of transfer after the first gigabyte. That means that for most business, SES will be significantly cheaper than Sendgrid or Mailgun. However, SES is as it\u2019s name implies, simple. There are no extra features like delivery, click, or open tracking. It\u2019s just a bare-bones delivery service and the documentation is not as stellar as Mailgun\u2019s. But if delivery cost is your overarching concern, then SES may be the best choice.</p><h3>Receiving email</h3><p>\r\n\tWhat if your web application not only needs to send email, but also needs to be able to receive email replies and parse them? Both Sendgrid and Mailgun support this feature. Amazon SES does not. Receiving email and automatically parsing it to provide meaningful data to a web app is not trivial and will take more development time. But beware, if you think your app needs both to send and receive email, you may be succumbing to <a title=\"Zawinski's Law\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski.27s_law_of_software_envelopment\" target=\"_blank\">Zawinsky\u2019s Law</a>.</p><p>\r\n\tSometimes email should just be left out of a web application in favor of a better application design that sufficiently models workflows to the point that outside communication is largely unnecessary.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>\r\n\tChoosing an email client, server, and delivery service is crucial to many businesses\u2019 online presence. Without reliable email services you or your users may be left out of the loop when it comes to workflows that involve email notification. Which services you choose depends largely on your organization\u2019s users and the requirements of your application. Once again Amazon Web Services is a low-cost leader and a good choice if you want to keep most of your services under one account. Pair that with Google Apps for Business and you will have a complete email solution for your organization.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\t<em>The third and final installment of an interview series with Dr. Mark Braunstein, Director of the Health Systems Institute at Georgia Tech, and columnist at InformationWeek. </em></p><p>\r\n\tWe all hate to think of our industry as being a \u201ctrailing edge industry,\u201d but until recently that\u2019s where the healthcare information technology sector was firmly seated \u2013 at least, in America. Recent advances in technology, combined with the sweeping overhauls coming with the Affordable Care Act, there has been no better time for entrepreneurs to grab the horns and ride this opportunity to success. Dr. Braunstein offers some insight into where one should start when looking for these opportunities.</p><h3>\r\n\tHealth Engagement: <em>Go Mobile</em>\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tAccording to Braunstein, an important way for entrepreneurs to get a foothold is to look at the population of patients.  \u201cWhen patients need to see multiple specialists and comply with 3 or often more different doctors\u2019 orders, following those orders can be a very difficult task,\u201d said Braunstein. \u201cNew mobile apps make it easier to engage with your provider \u2013 and the insurance company. New apps are released regularly, but no one really owns that market yet. There\u2019s still great opportunity for the company that finds an engagement method that really keeps people enthused.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tThere are a lot of mobile apps touting healthcare as their category. But a study came out in October of 2013 pointing out that, of the 43,000+ classified as mobile health apps, only 23,682 performed a legitimate health function. In other words, there is a lot of \u2018junk\u2019 and therefore a lot of opportunity. If you\u2019re looking for insight on what apps might still have market value, the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics has a lot of inspiring data for you. I found <a href=\"http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/imshealth/Global/Content/Corporate/IMS%20Health%20Institute/Reports/Patient_Apps/IIHI_Patient_Apps_Report.pdf\">this pdf</a> to be particularly interesting.</p><p>\r\n\tBut according to Braunstein, the Holy Grail for mobile healthcare apps remains the ability to engage. The two most popular categories at this time address changing patient behavior (diet, exercise, etc.) and improving how consumers follow their prescribed treatment regimen. The real trick for success in either of these categories is to find a way to keep the consumer engaged.<br>\r\n\t<em>(editor\u2019s note: watch for a new white paper from Smashing Boxes on mobile health and medication non-adherence)</em></p><h3>\r\n\te-Records: <em>Go Cloud</em>\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tNot surprisingly, Braunstein is bullish on the opportunities for entrepreneurs in the world of electronic records management, sometimes called EHR or EMR.</p><p>\r\n\t\u201cHere\u2019s a picture of where the growth will come from,\u201d he says, as he leads us down through the recent history of medical records. \u201cRight now, only 50% of primary care doctors are committed to implementing systems that require health care records be posted to EMR systems.  Only 75% of hospitals have thoroughly implemented a system. These doctors will soon have to get on board or part ways with their networks, because it will all be electronic in the near future.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tEvery organization that undertakes patient care across the country is moving or has moved to an electronic healthcare records management system.  Opportunities continue to abound, however. Many aspects of the care system have yet to be \u2018plugged in.\u2019 The incentive to change habits and expenditures is now in place.</p><p>\r\n\tSome estimate that healthcare technology is a $30 Billion industry \u2013 with room to grow. Those funding new companies understand this and are looking for better ways to use data and to engage patients&hellip; especially as doctors are now required to share data with patients. The cost of providing healthcare will drop significantly when the financial incentive is put into place, because not only does technology positively impact lower cost for care, but also more superior results.</p><h3>\r\n\tWhere to look for ideas\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tThe best way to find a real market need is to clearly understand the needs of the market!  Braunstein suggested that some upstarts might begin with where the money is today: Medicare/Medicaid. Opportunities become clear once you get to know the concerns of the more than 300 <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ACO/index.html?redirect=/ACO/\">Accountable Care Organizations</a> that are within the United States today. These groups of doctors, hospitals and other patient care organizations have come together voluntarily in order to give high quality, highly coordinated patient care. They are changing the way care is given today \u2013 and it\u2019s the technology behind their work that\u2019s allowing for that change.</p><p>\r\n\tIt might help for aspiring entrepreneurs to look into the field of Healthcare IT before thinking about the business they might start. In fact \u2013 it pays pretty well, as burgeoning fields often do. According to a <a href=\"http://www.ihealthbeat.org/picture-of-health/2014/what-is-the-average-health-it-salary-throughout-the-us\">January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2014 report</a> from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, the average salary for Healthcare IT pros is $113,000 per year. That\u2019s not executives \u2013 that\u2019s the average across all levels.</p><h5>\r\n\t<strong>Want more?</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tThis industry is vast, complex and growing. We can\u2019t realistically cover, in just three short blog posts, half of what we learned from Braunstein during this interview because each point he made led us down yet another path of research.</p><p>\r\n\tIf you\u2019re interested in knowing more, here are two suggestions:</p><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Take Braunstein\u2019s course: Georgia Tech has set up a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) on Health Informatics in the Cloud. <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/instructor/braunstein\">Contact Braunstein</a> to learn more about when the next course starts. Information on his most recent course is available <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/healthinformatics\">here</a>.</li>\t\r\n<li>\r\n\t<strong></strong>Attend the <a href=\"http://www.cednc.org/lifescience\">CED Life Science Conference 2014</a>. CED, NCBio and North Carolina Biotechnology Association have put together an amazing conference to offer ideas for how to navigate and prepare for \u201cHealthcare in 2020.\u201d You\u2019ll hear from the Commissioner of the FDA, from the former Commissioner of Social Security, many of the leading CEOs in pharma and healthcare technology, and more. A great investment for those considering a future in Healthcare IT.<strong></strong>\r\n\t</li></ol><p>\r\n\tTo learn more about the landscape of Healthcare IT read <a href=\"/ideas/the-impact-of-healthcare-it/\">The Impact of Healthcare IT Part 1: The Lay of the Land</a> and <a href=\"/ideas/the-impact-of-healthcare-it-part-2/\">The Impact of Healthcare IT Part 2: Big Data, Big Cloud, Big Finance</a>.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tOne of the first things your mother probably taught you was to cover your mouth when you cough. Spreading your germs to the other kids on the playground was a surefire bet to get them sick and result in an angry parent cursing under their breath at your mother for not raising you properly. In today\u2019s world of content marketing, things work a little differently. You want those germs to spread.</p><p>\r\n\tBy disseminating your knowledge to one person through social networking and digital relationship building, it can be passed on to lots of other people. When you\u2019re a thought leader, this recognition could be tripled, thanks to your expertise, personal experiences and unique perspective. The best thought leaders in the marketing industry build their brands through stories, and subsequently tell them to the world.</p><h3>It Comes in All Forms</h3><p>\r\n\tThe first thing you might be wondering is how will you be perceived as a thought leader if writing isn\u2019t your go-to talent. Here\u2019s a tip: you don\u2019t have to write. If you\u2019re a designer, post sketches of your latest logo or infographic and explain where they idea came from. UX designer? Push out your wireframes and discuss your usability testing (if you can make it public). Film a short video. Record a podcast. No matter where your talents lie, you can do more than put them into words.</p><h3>How to</h3><p>\r\n\tBecoming a thought leader, like anything else, involves dedication. So here are a few steps to get you there:</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>1.   Own your topic. </strong>On an individual level, this may mean owning your own personal talent. What are you uniquely good at? What area do you want to be seen as an expert in? Whether it\u2019s design, front-end development, UX, whatever, be vocal within those communities and see what personal or unique spin you can offer. Be disruptive. On a company level, this means finding the blank space. What are the needs your customers have but can\u2019t get fulfilled by a competitor?</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uber</a> did this in the public transportation sector. People were tired of waiting 20 minutes for a taxi and then scrounging around in their wallet for loose dollar bills or change. The Uber service broke through this wall of frustration by offering a service that involved the swipe of an app, the convenience of just a few minutes\u2019 wait time, no cash needed, and no tipping. Discover where your prowess lies and where it intersects with the betterment of your customers\u2019 lives.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTAvMDIvMTAvMzIvNTUvNjIyLzE0NjU2MzE0MzQ4X2YzYWE4YWNiNzhfei5qcGciXV0/14656314348_f3aa8acb78_z.jpg?sha=d7fdcee8\"></p><p>\r\n\t<strong>2. Who cares. </strong>But really, who cares? Every good marketer knows the importance of appealing to their target audience. But you\u2019re going to want to look past the standard \u201cmen, women, ages 25-35, black, white, dual income etc.\u201d obligatoriness. Ask yourself, \u201care we putting this content out for a startup of 10 people? Or a massive company with 10,000 people that has money to work with?\u201d Don\u2019t just talk to your audience to try and grab their attention, speak to them directly and find their pain points.</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://pizzaturnaround.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Domino\u2019s Pizza did this</a> in 2011 when they started seeing complaints on social media regarding their product. Unhappy customers unashamedly remarked that the chain\u2019s pizza tasted like \u201ccardboard\u201d and they would be more satisfied heating up a frozen pizza in their oven at home. Instead of re-targeting its brand message, Domino\u2019s spoke to their customers directly and literally, apologizing for the dissatisfaction and reconfigured its entire recipe book to make better-tasting pies. Caring about what your customers want and what they care about will show them that their happiness and success is important to you.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>3. Share the love. </strong>You can tweet out your thoughts a million times over or even strike up a conversation on Google+, but if you\u2019re not spreading your ideas with similar and influential networks, you might as well be eating chicken noodle soup by yourself. Take the time to find those key influencers who have klout in the same arena you do. Check out who they follow, who they\u2019re engaging with, and make sure they have a respectable network worth diving into.</p><p>\r\n\tNot naming names, but last year a BIG TIME developer at a BIG TIME company shared&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/introduction-to-the-mean-stack-video\" target=\"_blank\">one of our blog posts</a> on his website. To this day, that shared post drives 15 percent of all traffic to our website. So once you find someone worth engaging with, do just that. Strike up a conversation on Twitter with him or her, comment on their blog post with your personal perspective (and don\u2019t be afraid to disagree!), and get a conversation started. Once you\u2019re in the circle, you\u2019re there to stay. Take advantage.</p><p>\r\n\tSo get out there. Say what you need to say (cue John Mayer), put a new spin on an existing idea, or challenge an influencer in your space. Check out the \r\n\t<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/the-four-ps-of-entrepreneurship\">thought leadership</a> of our CEO, Nick Jordan, and see how personal perspective and expertise can create knowledge.</p>",

This is great for development and testing because you can have your mailers send all email to your own address with the intended recipient\u2019s address in the subject line.

I found this solution much more elegant that the one proposed by the article\u2019s author. First of all, you don\u2019t have to remember how to type this each time: </p><p>\t<code>YourAppsName::Application.config.setting_name</code> You just use:<br>\r\n\t<code>Settings.setting_name</code>Secondly, it\u2019s much faster:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"raw\">require 'benchmark'\r\nBenchmark.measure do (1..10000000).each { |i| Settings.from_email } end\r\n=&gt;   1.070000   0.050000   1.120000 (  1.126623)\r\nBenchmark.measure do (1..10000000).each { |i| Configurator::Application.config.wkhtmltopdf } end\r\n=&gt;  37.420000   0.030000  37.450000 ( 37.555091)\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tLast of all, if you\u2019re missing a setting, you get: \r\n\t<br>\r\n\t<code>false</code>\r\n\tInstead of:\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t<code>NoMethodError</code></p><p>\r\n\tHowever, do note that if the setting is missing the call carries a performance hit.\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t<code>method_missing</code></p>\r\n<pre class=\"raw\">Benchmark.measure do (1..10000000).each { |i| Settings.non_existant } end\r\n=&gt;   7.270000   0.010000   7.280000 (  7.371067)\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tSeven times slower than a hit, but still not bad compared to the example.\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t<code>Configurator</code></p><p>\r\n\tI made some improvements to @iq9\u2032s code. First I put all the initialization stuff in a class method. This method gets called once when the app starts up. But you can call it again later if your configuration has changed. This may come in handy for testing or if your settings frequently change but you don\u2019t want to have to restart the app.</p><p>\r\n\tI replied \r\n\t<a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/11/23/configuration-for-rails-the-right-way/#comment-466057672\">in a comment</a> with a technique that can be used to override settings. In my tests I wanted to cover both intercepted emails and regular emails, so I used this code: </p><p>\t<code>minitest</code></p>\r\n<pre class=\"raw\">it \"should not intercept emails\" do\r\n      Settings.instance_variable_set(:@intercept_email, false)\r\n      UserMailer.send(\"test@example.com\", \"testing\", \"123\")\r\n      FakeWeb.last_request.body.must_equal \"from=#{ERB::Util.url_encode Settings.from_email}&amp;to=test%40example.com&amp;subject=testing&amp;html=123\"\r\n      Settings.reload\r\nend\r\nit \"should intercept emails\" do\r\n      UserMailer.send(\"test@example.com\", \"testing\", \"123\")\r\n      FakeWeb.last_request.body.must_equal \"from=#{ERB::Util.url_encode Settings.from_email}&amp;to=#{ERB::Util.url_encode Settings.intercept_email}&amp;subject=%5Btest%40example.com%5D%20testing&amp;html=123\"\r\nend&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><p><em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Check out our open source projects on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://github.com/smashingboxes\">GitHub</a><em style=\"background-color: initial;\">.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Cover photo by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaja_1985/\" style=\"font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\"><em>Jarno</em></a></p>",

Researching where your product fits into the marketplace is a vital component to achieving success early on. In this blog post, you\u2019ll hear from some of our seasoned researchers and strategists on best practices and tools for exploring market opportunities.<br>\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><h4>Your Audience and Competitive Research</h4><p><br>\r\n</p><p>In the internet age, we are all competing for an incredibly valuable resource: time. The success of a product\u2014new or existing\u2014correlates directly to whether users believe the product can, has, or will add significant value to their lives through its use.\r\n</p><p>At the bare minimum, new products must accomplish something that people need or want and, in some scenarios, both. Not all people need and want the same things\u2014your product must focus on delivering value for a specific group of people: your primary audience.\r\n</p><p>Identifying your audience does not take place after you launch your new product. Successful products hone in on their target throughout the design and development process, with the help and feedback of potential (or actual) end users.\r\n</p><p>When developing a go-to-market strategy, it is imperative that you conduct thorough market research, define and find a target audience, and involve end users in the design process.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><h4>Secondary Research: How to get started</h4><p><br>\r\n</p><p>How do you determine what people might need and want?\r\n</p><p>For your first step, conduct a thorough analysis of the existing landscape. As you conduct your research, compare a set of both primary and secondary competitors. Even if a product does not offer the exact same services and benefits as yours, there are still lessons to be learned from their failures, success, and overall business model. The more products you have to evaluate and benchmark against, the more insights you\u2019ll stand to gain.\r\n</p><p><em>There\u2019s a wealth of information to acquire, and you\u2019re going to need all of it. Information is power.\r\n\t</em>\r\n</p><p>As you conduct market research, it is vital to document and track your newly acquired knowledge of your target market. If working with a team, we recommend the use of collaborative management tools such as Evernote, Google Docs, or Basecamp.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><h5><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/b6F19uN6ZE1Yyxug0SUnaCQcnQsYCx7nfienl5-mekjIddHnxMi8ykwQUnpfVl5E2UXZcc5BXJfyBHHVHLvjpS9QSnYyKAdjnNtRcJ5sTAB4eK4taezcz_6sypzw_X2q=s1600\"></h5><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Entities analyzed for a recent fashion-specific project.

These tools are mostly offer some free level of service, though there are additional paid tools that you and your team could leverage.\r\n</p><p><strong>Startup company databases\r\n\t</strong>\r\n</p><p>If there\u2019s a market opportunity, chances are that someone is working on a startup to disrupt that market and take advantage of that opportunity. Startup company databases provide insight into early- and growth-stage startups that are developing new products and pivoting their businesses to take advantage of new opportunities in the marketplace. Use these databases to identify new entrants into the market, how much funding they have acquired, information about founders, relevant investors, and notable board members. Here are three places to start your research on startups:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/\"><u>Crunchbase</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://yclist.com/\"> <u>YC List</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://angel.co/\"> <u>AngelList</u></a></li>\r\n</ul><p><strong>Mobile app evaluation tools\r\n\t</strong>\r\n</p><p>A thorough survey of mobile applications available on the Apple Store and on the Google Play Store will help you uncover the categories your assumed competitors have listed. You can also perform keyword research to determine how competing products are found by their audience. As you conduct research, be sure to note opportunities that you identify to be featured in specific sections of the Apple or Google Play Stores such as less competitive or seasonally-relevant categories. Here are a few places to start your research on mobile applications:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/\"><u>App Annie</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.mobileaction.co/\"><u>Mobile Action</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li>Store Direct Reviews (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8\"><u>App Store</u></a>,<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps?utm_source=na_Med&amp;utm_medium=hasem&amp;utm_content=May0315&amp;utm_campaign=Evergreen&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-DR-na-us-dsk-Med-hasem-ap-Evergreen-May0315-64259107948-EXA%7cONSEM_kwid_43700007229200881&amp;gclid=CPmv-YeUhscCFVdnNwoduy8BLQ&amp;gclsrc=ds\"> <u>Google Play Store</u></a>)</li>\r\n\t<li>\u201cCustomers Also Bought\u201d (App Store) or \u201cSimilar\u201d (Google Play Store)</li>\r\n</ul><p><strong>Website evaluation tools\r\n\t</strong>\r\n</p><p>Once you\u2019ve identified potential competitors, you\u2019ll want to take an additional step: determining their traffic referral sources and noting what other web properties their audience visits. By using these five tools, you may be able to determine the volume of users within a given time period, see growth trends or seasonality of use, and also get an indication of the specific referral sources from which the competitor\u2019s website traffic derives. Here are five website evaluation tools that may help you as you conduct your research:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.similarweb.com/\"><u>SimilarWeb</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/\"><u>Alexa</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compete.com/\"><u>Compete</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.quantcast.com/\"><u>Quantcast</u></a></li>\r\n\t<li><u><a href=\"https://www.consumerbarometer.com/en/\">Consumer Barometer</a></u></li>\r\n</ul><p><span style=\"line-height: 20px;\"><br></span>\r\n</p><h4>Market Research: strategies for evaluating competitors</h4><p><br>\r\n</p><p>Once you\u2019ve completed your thorough research of competitors using the above tools, it\u2019s time to evaluate each competitor to identify if they truly are \u201cthe competition.\u201d\r\n</p><p>In your survey, you may seek to discover:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>How many competitors are in the marketplace, and what are their products?</li>\r\n\t<li>Which of these competitors are successful? Which are not? If competitors are startups, have any sold their company or licensed their product\u2014or have any folded and gone out of business?</li>\r\n\t<li>What features, designs, and experiences of competing products add distinct value to the end user, ultimately making the product successful?</li>\r\n\t<li>What features, designs, and experiences are absolutely necessary to create value for end users?</li>\r\n\t<li>What features, designs, or experiences are missing? How might you make it easier for the user to engage with your product rather than a competing product?</li>\r\n</ul><p>There are many different ways to conduct a strategic analysis of competitors\u2014we\u2019ve compiled a brief list of suggested tools:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Create a SWOT Matrix to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats;</li>\r\n\t<li>Conduct a CARVER Analysis with specific evaluation criteria; and/or</li>\r\n\t<li>Deploy a Strategy Canvas to compare products across companies or industries.</li>\r\n</ul><p><span style=\"line-height: 20px;\"><br></span>\r\n</p><p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/beL1-RJn_J_dH3S1cta5FO4ZOj4gjCXXnLl6IX6xrjfjJCroFDgrt_cfHMR4tCPyVP1Mv9GPNyETHyAqzWHY_YJIIkmzFeDZF3fGLfNQlrl8U9G4mp5OFw29OEQ5zHNzwg=s1600\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A strategy canvas graphs competing value factors and the offering levels of businesses that are directly or indirectly operating in the same marketplace.

This particular strategy canvas maps a client in the social photo sharing space against potential competitors such as Snapchat and Slingshot. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><br></em></p><p>It is important to keep an open mind going into your analysis--determining a strategy too early may limit or skew opportunities for your product. Selecting a strategy may depend on the direction you want to take your idea and your product. Do you want mass adoption, or will targeting a niche market be a priority? Who might be your target user group, and what is the problem that you are helping them solve?\r\n</p><h5><br></h5><h4>Your Target Audience: how to get started </h4><p><br>\r\n</p><p>You may not have a crystal clear idea of who will be using or buying your product when you start conducting market research\u2014but you sure need a clear understanding of your target audience before you complete product design.\r\n</p><p>Many product designers do not know where to start, because they do not possess an existing set of audience insights, and sometimes they do not possess an audience at all. If you don\u2019t have an existing set of audience insights with which to work, that\u2019s okay. While great to have this data, it is not essential to high quality audience targeting.\r\n</p><p>By utilizing a set of hypotheses about your potential audience, you\u2019re able to construct a framework in which to test those hypotheses and determine whether your assumptions are valid. Successful product designers test assumptions before designing the product\u2014and many times, even before building a prototype!\r\n</p><p>In order to test your hypotheses, you may wish to consider the following tactics:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Formal or informal surveys, conducted online or in-person;</li>\r\n\t<li>Formal or informal focus groups, usually consisting of between 8-12 people;</li>\r\n\t<li>Analyzing social media messages using social listening tools or sentiment analysis;</li>\r\n\t<li>Competitive analysis;</li>\r\n\t<li>Studying pre-existing industry or market survey and study results; and/or</li>\r\n\t<li>Third-party research (from providers like comScore, Simmons, MRI, or others). </li>\r\n</ul><p>By utilizing these methods, or other methods of testing your product assumptions and ideas within potential audience segments, you\u2019ll gain the insight you need to segment your audience appropriately and begin to form personas. Inevitably, the work you invest in defining your audience segments will result in an effective product-market fit and enable you to bring your product to market successfully.\r\n</p><h5><br></h5><h4>Other Methods for \u201cIdea Vetting\u201d</h4><p><br>\r\n</p><p>There are a multitude of ways to leverage the power of your personal and professional networks to test your product idea and your hypotheses about proper audience or audience segments.\r\n</p><p>One of the best ways to test hypotheses is to leverage personal connections\u2014individuals that you know or individuals within a common group or community are often glad to help when properly asked. Leveraging pre-existing relationships can yield quick feedback on your product idea and hypotheses.\r\n</p><p>How do you find people that fall inside your assumed user groups to test your hypotheses? Here are a few additional tactics that you may use to identify these groups:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Are you a member of a community of people that have similar interests or problems that your product aims to solve?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is there a Meetup group that attracts individuals from within your target audience segment?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do you know any community organizers or leaders that would let you run a short workshop or give a short presentation at one of their events?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are you a member of a club, non-profit, church group, athletic team, or professional community? Consider formally or informally asking folks for feedback.</li>\r\n</ul><p>When you meet and interact with people who are the assumed target for you product, it\u2019s important to work to understand their needs, their desires, and their pain points. While in conversation, embrace your empathetic side\u2014many of the best connectors are experts in empathy, and always listen more than they speak. You\u2019ll find that they ask a wide range and variety of questions, always aimed at finding out information like:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>What does my target customer value? </li>\r\n\t<li>What does my target customer spend money on, and how much?</li>\r\n\t<li>What are the short- and long-term goals of my target customer? </li>\r\n\t<li>What\u2019s one thing that would make every day life better for my target customer?</li>\r\n\t<li>Where does my customer believe they waste resources (money, time, products)?</li>\r\n</ul><p>To fully identify and uncover a target market or audience segments within a target market, you must consistently and adequately test the market. To do so requires flexibility, an investment of time and resources, and empathy.\r\n</p><p>The end result of this initial phase will never be 100% accurate, and that\u2019s okay because much of the learning will come later when you begin to build out your product and test it with real users. In this testing you may find that your assumptions are correct, and you may find that they were incorrect and uncover a new market not previously considered.\r\n</p><p>By appropriately testing your assumptions and hypotheses, successful product designers learn valuable information that can be incorporated into the final design, ensuring better usability and happier end users. In the next article in this blog series, we\u2019ll discuss methods for using prototyping to test the market you\u2019ve identified and uncover value.\r\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>Twitter\u2019s design team is famously open about their process and thinking. It\u2019s fascinating to observe as they work through updating and improving their applications to make them more appealing to a large and diverse group of people engaging on different platforms contexts. The degree to which they\u2019ve succeeded is impressive, but that\u2019s not to say that every decision makes sense to an end user. Particularly, without the benefit of having been a part of the research, observation, and iteration that led to it.<br>\r\n</p><p>Based on my understanding of the vision driving Twitter, the ability of a user to follow and be followed by other users is second in importance only to the user\u2019s ability to send tweets. Without the concept of following, Twitter devolves into a mob of people shouting at each other.\r\n</p><p>That\u2019s why I was surprised by the design team\u2019s decision to hide the Follow button while scrolling through another user\u2019s timeline on Android and iOS devices (web maintains the button\u2019s visibility). Depending on the height of the user\u2019s device and the length of the most recent tweets, a mobile user will typically be able to read around three (but as few as one) tweets before scrolling the Follow button off the top of the screen.\r\n</p><iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/TartTerribleCrocodile\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);padding-left:0.65rem\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n</iframe><p style=\"text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;margin-top:-1rem\"><em>Current review and follow interaction with disappearing Follow button</em>\r\n</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\"><strong>Experience Failure?</strong></h3><p>Do one to three tweets provide enough information to make a decision on whether to follow another user? In some cases, yes. Personally, and for a handful of other users I asked during an informal research session (details below), the answer is no. During that research session, three general follow scenarios emerged:\r\n</p><ol>\r\n\t<li>\u201cA friend recommended that I follow a particular user, so I am going to follow him or her. This includes public figures, friends of friends, etc.\u201d </li>\r\n\t<li>\u201cAn unfollowed user has come to my attention via a single retweet or contribution to a trending hashtag.\u201d</li>\r\n\t<li>\u201cAn unfollowed user has come to my attention via repeated retweets or contributions to trending hashtags over time.\u201d</li>\r\n</ol><p>In scenario 1, the user is not affected by the disappearing Follow button, as the decision to follow has already been made.\r\n</p><p>In scenario 2, given the limited insight into the unfollowed user\u2019s tweeting habits, the potential follower is interested in discovering both quality of tweets and approximate volume of tweeting.\r\n</p><p>In scenario 3, a perception of consistent quality already exists, so the potential follower is nearly committed to following (similar to scenario 1) but still may have questions about quality and volume. This desire to learn more coupled with limited viewable tweets on a mobile screen means that scrolling through the timeline is likely before a decision to follow is made. If the potential follower scrolls 10, 20, 50 tweets down before deciding to follow, he or she must subsequently remember that the follow button exists, remember where it is (after potentially trying to discover it somewhere on-screen), and then scroll back to the top of the profile before again locating and tapping the Follow button. That\u2019s significant thinking and interaction between decision and action, and ample opportunity for an experience failure.\r\n</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\">Reaching out</h3><p>Given the insights gained from my personal use patterns and informal research, I assume the decision to scroll the Follow button away was explicit and arrived at after extensive research, observation, and testing, which serves only to further pique my interest. Curious, I tweeted @design, Twitter\u2019s in-house design team\u2019s account.\r\n</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">Yo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/design\">@design</a> - Curious as to the thinking behind not keeping the Follow button visible when the user scrolls down the mobile timeline<br>\u2014 Dante Passera (@dantepassera) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dantepassera/status/607942625656750080\">June 8, 2015</a>\r\n</blockquote><p>In spite of the one whole favorite that tweet earned, I never heard back from Twitter. I\u2019m almost glad I didn\u2019t though, because it\u2019s given me an opportunity to conduct informal and rapid testing on potential improvements to a discrete piece of UI functionality in an existing project.\r\n</p><p>To reiterate, <em>this is not a takedown</em>. As a creative professional, I understand the competing interests that lead to the ultimate implementation of a design. There is a reason that the Follow button scrolls off the screen. Since I wasn\u2019t a part of that initial design process, however, I can\u2019t speculate on what it might be. Instead, I\u2019ll present three options for making sure the Follow button is immediately accessible at the moment of decision to follow, while disrupting the current UI as little as possible.\r\n</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\">Validating Potential Need For Improvement</h3><p>Now that I was about to embark upon a course of prototyping and testing, I wanted to verify my assumptions about the difficulty in executing a follow action. To that end, I created a Pixate prototype based on the current Twitter Android app, presented it to a group of eight web-only Twitter users, and had them execute the following task:\r\n</p><p style=\"font-size:1.5rem\"><em>\u201cDecide to follow and then follow this profile\u201d</em>\r\n</p><p>Six of eight users scrolled before attempting to follow. Of those,\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Three scrolled back to the top and tapped Follow</li>\r\n\t<li>Two scrolled down, tapped the overflow menu, closed the overflow menus, scrolled back to the top and tapped Follow\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>One scrolled down, tapped the user name and exited the profile, returned to the profile, and tapped Follow\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul><iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/TartTerribleCrocodile\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);padding-left:0.65rem;margin-top:3rem;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n</iframe><p style=\"text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;margin-top:-1rem;\"><em>User exhibits desired behavior</em>\r\n</p><iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/WigglyUnnaturalGoitered\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);padding-left:0.65rem;margin-top:3rem;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n</iframe><p style=\"text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;margin-top:-1rem;\"><em>User searches in overflow for follow button</em>\r\n</p><iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/BestRevolvingHarvestmen\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);padding-left:0.65rem;margin-top:3rem;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n</iframe><p style=\"text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;margin-top:-1rem;\"><em>User guesses incorrectly at functionality</em>\r\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:3rem;\">While each user was able to discover how to follow, there was substantial pausing to review and consider options, as seen in the test videos, as well as one instance of a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d action - exiting the profile.\r\n</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\">Creating and Testing Potential Solutions</h3><p>Based on these observations and my own instincts, I created the three following Pixate prototypes, each with the benefit of not requiring a scroll reset to follow, and each with unique perceived pros and cons:\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;margin-top:2rem;\"><strong>Option 1: Display Follow/Unfollow in action bar on scroll\r\n\t</strong>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;padding-left:0.5rem;margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;\">\r\n\t<iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/UnequaledElectricGreathornedowl\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n\t</iframe>\r\n</p><p style=\"max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:-0.75rem\">Pro: Persistent display of Follow button and status; Spatial connection with original follow button; Highly visible; Consistent with action bar and follow button styling\r\n</p><p style=\"max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">Con: Adds visual complication to action bar; Displays screen-level action adjacent to and in same style of app-level action (Twitter search)\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;margin-top:4rem;\"><strong>Option 2: Replace action bar tweet count with Follow/Unfollow on scroll</strong>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;padding-left:0.5rem;margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;\">\r\n\t<iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/FirmInfamousAmericanpainthorse\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n\t</iframe>\r\n</p><p style=\"max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:-0.75rem\">Pro: Persistent display of Follow button and status; Clear spatial association between name and follow status; Removes confusing history back action from name interaction\r\n</p><p style=\"max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">Con: Spatially disconnected from original follow button; Visually distinct from original follow button; Requires discovery of purpose\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;margin-top:4rem;\"><strong>Option 3: Display Follow/Unfollow in overflow menu</strong>\r\n</p><p style=\"text-align: center;padding-left:0.5rem;margin-top:2rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;\">\r\n\t<iframe src=\"http://gfycat.com/ifr/SophisticatedReadyCat\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" width=\"292\">\r\n\t</iframe>\r\n</p><p style=\"max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top:-0.75rem\">Con: Further complicates overflow menu; Requires discovery of existence\r\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:2rem;\">These prototypes, along with the original stock prototype, were tested with six of the eight original web-only users and 11 mobile-primary users. Because of the limited time available and informal nature of this test session, I again presented the users with a single, simple task to be executed on each of the four prototypes:\r\n</p><p style=\"font-size:1.5rem\"><em>\u201cRead enough tweets to decide to follow and then follow this profile\u201d</em>\r\n</p><p>Each user was then asked which version allowed them to most easily complete the above task, and only two indicated the current approach (scrolling up to Follow). Of the rest,\r\n</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>12 stated a preference for option 1 (Follow button in actionbar)</li>\r\n\t<li>3 preferred option 2 (Action bar tweet count replaced by Follow button)</li>\r\n\t<li>0 preferred option 3 (Follow button in overflow)</li>\r\n</ul><p>What\u2019s more, no confusion was observed when engaging with option 1, as Follow actions immediately following cessation of scrolling. With option 2, some users still scrolled back to the original Follow button, and only one user found the overflow Follow button in option 3 before scrolling back to the original Follow button.\r\n</p><h3>Recommendation </h3><p>Based on the feedback gathered from observation, conversation, and my own experience and instincts, adding a Follow button to the action bar on scroll is the clearly preferred method of handling non-immediate following. This also appears to be the option least disruptive to the UI, especially given my lack of direct knowledge of the research, business goals, etc. that helped to determine the current design, and the easiest for the development team to implement.\r\n</p><p>I personally like some aspects of option 2 as I find the tweet count by itself lacking in useful or actionable information. Also, breaking up that history back button would reduce the number of unexpected returns to the main timeline. That option, however, has its own issues related to visibility and button consistency. Option 3 is the quickest of quick fixes and should be used only as a stop-gap measure, if at all.\r\n</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:1.5rem\">Hunting For Deeper Meaning</h3><p>I\u2019m confident in the above recommendation as a solution to the discrete issue of the disappearing Follow button but, again, am intensely curious as to the thinking and requirements that led to the UI\u2019s current behavior. Looked at in a vacuum, just about any design decision can be second guessed, and the maturity of a designer or design team can be measured by its ability to accept a superficial design flaw in service to a deeper design or business goal.\r\n</p><br><em>If @design or anyone else has additional insight into this aspect of the UI or would like to point out something blatantly obvious that I missed, I\u2019d love to continue the conversation </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/dantepassera\"><em>on Twitter</em></a><em> or in the comments below.<p><br></p><p>Cover photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkhmarketing/\" class=\"owner-name truncate\" title=\"Go to mkhmarketing's photostream\" data-track=\"attributionNameClick\" data-rapid_p=\"35\">mkhmarketing</a>.</p></em>",

        "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<em>\u201cEasy to make larger, more powerful, etc\u201d</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<em>- Merriam-Webster Dictionary</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhen I first started making websites, one of my most enjoyable steps in development was creating the visuals. The visuals make the site come alive by giving it a personality and an identity. Who doesn\u2019t like something that\u2019s pretty? CSS is what adds the visual layer to a website. Without CSS the website would look boring. Compare this \r\n\t<a href=\"https://academic.cuesta.edu/acasupp/DSPS/curbcut/test.htm\">page</a> without CSS to this <a href=\"http://24ways.org/\">page</a> with CSS. There is a huge difference.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCSS is easy to learn, but difficult to master. The syntax is very easy to understand and the properties make sense. If you want a box with a blue background you type:</p>\r\n<pre>#box { background:blue  }\r\n</pre><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tEasy peasy. Now you have a box with a blue background.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCSS for easy basic designs is simple and pretty straightforward. CSS for complex designs is not simple. Catching a football is pretty easy if one is thrown at you. Catching multiple footballs is where it gets tough.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThis is where Scalable CSS comes into play. You want your code to be easily managed and maintained, even if the site gets larger and more complex. I like to separate my CSS files like so:</p><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\tBasic Infrastructure\r\n\t</p></li>\t\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\tLayout\r\n\t</p></li>\t\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\tComponents\r\n\t</p></li>\t\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\tComponent States\r\n\t</p></li></ol><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTypically I import these styles into my Basic Infrastructure CSS file in development. When in deployment you can minify each and put them into a single CSS file.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tKeep in mind that each project is different but generally all projects have the same CSS foundations.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBasic Infrastructure\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThis is where we set the basic infrastructure for the site. Normally, these are single and pseudo element selectors that set the general style for the whole site. Typical elements and styling here would be setting the link colors, the heading font sizes, or the paragraph line height. Here is an example:</p>\r\n<pre>a { text-decoration: none; color: blue }\r\nh1 { font-size: 2em; color: blue }\r\nh2 { font-size: 1.5em; color: lightblue }\r\np { line-height: 3px }\r\n</pre><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tYou could also reset styles here.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLayout\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHere we set the layout styles. This is pretty straightforward and work can be minimal if we use frameworks such as \r\n\t<a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> or <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a>. Layout styles are basically the header, the sidebar, and the content. I like to think of the layout styles similar to a wireframe. The layout styles dictate the components.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QHZNI9XJaaSB0iktS7og-RMYGNyOWSQoE71lCn62Foz8_GDmZKjX-DOCy_wrgL_kT6HVyvEYhAKbf-apM97fHmCQLCvLevZ9fGWswEmbElO8Oe1oRLehyD7cuw\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"491px;\"></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tComponents\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tComponents are the elements that live inside the layout blocks. Examples of these are the navigational menu that lives inside the header, the Twitter feed that lives in the sidebar, and the website info that lives inside the footer. Be careful of what you name your classes as these styles can be the most hefty.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tComponent States\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA component might have different states. A menu might have an expanded state or a hidden state. These can go in the components stylesheet or you can have a separate one to keep organization. Here is an example of component states</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<pre>.nav li.hidden { display: none;}\r\n.nav li.expanded { display: block; }\r\n</pre><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Extra Jazz To Help Organization</strong></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSASS\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIf you aren\u2019t using SASS already, you should be. Quoted from the \r\n\t<a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">SASS website</a> as \u201cCSS with superpowers\u201d SASS has many useful features that help the with organization. One such feature is nested selectors. This makes stylesheets shorter. However be careful not to nest too deep as this can cause confusion and conflicts. Here is an example of SASS modified from the example above:</p>\r\n<pre>.nav {\r\n  li.hidden {\r\n     display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.nav {\r\n  li.expanded {\r\n    display: block;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</pre><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFrameworks\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA Web Framework is great as it does the heavy lifting for you. Frameworks take care of the Basic Infrastructure, Layout, Components, and Component states, leaving you with very little to no CSS markup. Here are a few great frameworks:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> (of course)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Zurb Foundation</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://neat.bourbon.io/\">Bourbon Neat</a></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tConclusion\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSeparation of CSS files is very helpful for maintaining a larger site. Separation based on like elements helps if someone else has to go into my code to make changes. I try to stick to the same patterns every time I code in case upkeep is not done by me. All in all this is my approach to make my CSS Scalable. It works for me and hopefully it works for you.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tNo matter where you look on the web today, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/responsive-web-design-guidelines-tutorials/\">Responsive Design</a> is there.</p><p>\r\n\tPeople are using the internet more than it ever thanks to the many devices these days having access to the web. A key job of a designer is to make sure they create something that is not only easily accessible and used by the user, but also accessible on any platform that best reaches the user. To do this in the ancient days of the web, we would have to create separate pages and even separate sites for a user to access a site or application on their phone and other devices. But now-a-days, we\u2019ve simplified that process.</p><p>\r\n\tIn Today\u2019s web, we integrate everything into one site. Why? This minimizes the page load and loading time between multiple devices, as well as makes it functional for the user no matter where they may be and what platform they may be using. People can access a site that is on a computer as well as by phones and other devices. If we didn\u2019t use responsive design, the user would be given one big site that fails to look functional on their screen. They would have to zoom in and pray that they click the right link or button, squinting to read any information you are trying to provide to them.</p><p>\r\n\tWith Responsive Design, we fix this problem. A site that looks good on a computer, will also look good on a tablet and phone, no matter the screen size. We alter the sizes of images and fonts, so they can be properly displayed on the providing screen. And lets face it, with computer screens being as big as they are, we tend to add a bit of extra design and functionality to the page, so that the user can have a decent experience. However, the tools a laptop may provide aren\u2019t necessarily provided with a phone or tablet. We don\u2019t have a mouse to look around and click. We don\u2019t have a massive screen to view things on. When our screen minimizes, so does our functionality.</p><p>\r\n\tExample: Many big sites these days have Drop down menus. The issue? A phone does not have enough room to have a giant drop-down, much less list all the options across the top of our page. Additionally, phones do not have a mouse that allows easy downward scrolling while that drop-down is open. Solution? Create a drop-down that works on the users desktop or laptop computer, but also minimizes into a pop-out sidebar or options list when it gets to a smaller height. This way the user can just use their finger to navigate throughout the site with ease, but still have a successful experience on their computer.</p><h3>\r\n\tWhat are some of the positive effects?\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tWell, for one, your client will be happy. Instead of having to make several side pages and sites like we used to, we can incorporate everything on one site or page that works on all platforms. This means less money out of your clients\u2019 pockets, preventing them from having to pay for extra server space and urls. The mobility that you provide will satisfy users of the site. Instead of having to be redirected, they just go straight to the site and use the app as intended. You get to write less code and have less to manage, saving more money for your client and you have more time to spend on more important things.</p><h3>\r\n\tHow do I use Responsive Design?\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tThe next step in the process is Media Queries. Media Queries are CSS-based and they\u2019re handy little wrappers that allow you to add/remove or even change a page\u2019s design based on the device\u2019s screen width. No more having to use JavaScript to detect the size of your browser. The Media Queries do this for you and actually help you minimize the amount of JavaScript you use.</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/responsive-design-layout.png\"><img src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/responsive-design-layout-300x225.png\" alt=\"responsive design\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4587\"></a></p><h5>\r\n\t<em>Percentages and Ems</em>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tInstead of using a specific width, (960px sound familiar?), we want to retain flexibility throughout all devices. This is where it would help to better understand percentages and ems. These two things will help change your element sizes based off of certain factors; how big your screen is being the biggest one. However, one specific percentage still may not look good on other devices. Fifty percent for a phone is much more different than fifty percent on a desktop screen.</p><h5>\r\n\t<em>Media Queries</em>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tIn the event that something looks wrong on a different screen-size, Media Queries will jump into play. Media Queries are used within your CSS to detect screen-size and even type. They even cover whether the user\u2019s phone or tablet may be in landscape mode or portrait mode. After detecting all this information, you can pass some CSS through the Media Query to go to this device only. This disables or overwrites styles you may need to change or don\u2019t need at all.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>This is an Example Media Query:</strong></p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;link href=\"css/medium.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"screen \r\nand (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 900px)\" /&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tAs you can see, we\u2019re targeting any screen, with a minimum width of 701px and a max width of 900 px. This means that any device with a detectable screen between the widths of 701px and 900 px will be using this CSS.</p><p>\r\n\tTo make things easier, there are many sources out there for you to build responsively. The most convenient resources are frameworks that were built out to be responsive.</p><p>\r\n\tTwo of the best frameworks are:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li><a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Zurb Foundation</a></li>\t\r\n<li><a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a></li></ul><p>\r\n\tAdditional resources:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li><a href=\"http://mattkersley.com/responsive/\">Responsive Design Test</a></li>\t\r\n<li><a href=\"http://getwirefy.com/\">Wirefy</a></li>\t\r\n<li><a href=\"http://adaptive-images.com/\">Adaptive Images</a></li>\t\r\n<li><a href=\"https://gridsetapp.com/\">Gridset</a></li>\t\r\n<li><a href=\"http://fittextjs.com/\">FitText</a></li></ul><p>\r\n\tResponsive Design is growing at an incredible rate, especially considering the fact that most of the sites you find on the web now are web applications, and not just web-sites. I think it best that all designers and developers know how to work with this process. It may look and seem complicated at first, but honestly it\u2019s very easily integrated into your normal flow of work.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<h3>What is Domain Logic?</h3><p>\r\n\tAll software has a domain in which it attempts to solve problems. This can be equivalent to a real-world business or to a field of engineering or math. The domain logic is the representation of the business rules of the domain being modeled. In object-oriented software engineering, a domain object model is used to model problem domain objects, or objects that have a direct counterpart in the problem domain. \r\n\t<a title=\"Ivar Jacobson, Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0201544350\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTraditionally, domain logic in \r\n\t<a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby on Rails</a> is modelled in <a title=\"ActiveRecord::Base\" href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html\" target=\"_blank\">ActiveRecord</a> models. ActiveRecord is the default object-relational mapping (ORM) library for Rails. Hence, objects that represent domain logic are also responsible for persisting or saving data attributes to a relational database.\r\n</p><h3>The Great Debate</h3><p>\r\n\tThere are two radically different schools of thought on combining domain logic with a persistence layer or ORM. First, we have Uncle Bob, one of the authors of the \r\n\t<a title=\"Authors: The Agile Manifesto\" href=\"http://www.agilemanifesto.org/authors.html\" target=\"_blank\">Agile Manifesto</a>:\r\n</p><blockquote>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u201cThe opportunity we miss when we structure our applications around Active Record is the opportunity to use object oriented design.\u201d \r\n\t\t<a title=\"Robert Martin, Active Record Vs. Objects\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/active-record-vs-objects\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>\r\n\t</blockquote><p>\r\n\tThe context of that quote is about the confusion caused when you have objects that also happen to be data structures. Objects in object-oriented programming are diametrically opposed to data structures. Objects expose behavior while data structures have no behavior.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThen, we have David Heinemeier Hansson\u2013creator of Rails, proponent of opinionated software:\r\n</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh\">@dhh</a> \u2014 It\u2019s great to hear your comments on the latest memes in Rubyland/web dev. What are your thoughts on separating logic + persistence.\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2014 Paul Campbell (@paulca) \r\n\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulca/statuses/218740007878406145\">June 29, 2012</a>\r\n\t</blockquote><p>\r\n\tFrom this tweet we can see DHH\u2019s opinion that a Rails application is a web app and nothing else. We shouldn\u2019t be concerned about separating non-application specific business logic from our framework. We shouldn\u2019t need to re-use our domain logic outside of Rails.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSo we have a dilemma. Should we follow Uncle Bob\u2019s advice and isolate our domain logic from our database layer? Or should we keep on doing things the Rails way and use the active record pattern (which also happens to be named \r\n\t<a href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html\">ActiveRecord</a>) to both model behavior and persist data?<br>\r\n\t<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4141\" alt=\"bob-vs-dhh\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bob-vs-dhh.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"600\">\r\n</p><h3>The Problem with Rails</h3><p>\r\n\tIn many cases, DHH is right. Our little pet-project blog app is nothing more than a blog. Its business logic is intimately tied to the delivery platform\u2014the web. There is no need to separate out the domain logic. It\u2019s just a simple CRUD app.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBut what happens when your app is more than just a blog? What if your application needs to model complex behavior\u2014say, a payroll app. You have dozens of models and your tests start to take longer and longer with complex database interactions. Then you start wanting to separate out business logic by \r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/extracting-domain-objects\">extracting domain objects</a>. You mock or stub out your tests and they are moving fast again. But still, your views and controllers are tightly coupled with your models, reaching far inside to extract data. It can\u2019t all be tested easily except by huge integration tests.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf those problems sound all too familiar, you might be ready to re-discover some practices and approaches that have worked well in the history of software engineering.\r\n</p><h3>The Solution: Object-Oriented Design</h3><p>\r\n\tIt just so happens that what\u2019s needed to speed up our tests is the same things that are good for object-oriented software design. There are a handful of time-tested approaches that can make our applications faster, easier to maintain, and more bug-free. The first principle is single-responsibility. Each class should be responsible for a single concern. Put another way, classes should only have a single reason to change. If a class is responsible for too much it will require frequent changes and make the application more fragile.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tRails\u2019 models, which inherit from ActiveRecord::Base, are responsible for both domain logic and persistence. This is one responsibility too many. So the first step in refactoring a fragile Rails application is putting all domain logic in Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs). Free from the constraints of the database we can now model our domain in a fully object-oriented way. We can use object-oriented design patterns such as inheritance, facades, decorators, and so on. For a full description of many such design patterns a good reference is \r\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\"><em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em></a>.\r\n</p><h5><strong>Dependency Inversion</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe next approach we will explore is creating a boundary that inverts the dependencies between controllers, views, and models. According to Uncle Bob\u2019s \r\n\t<a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\" target=\"_blank\">Clean Architecture</a>, software dependencies should all point towards higher-level business rules. The database, web, and other external interfaces thus become the lowest-level implementation details. This is the reverse of how Rails applications are often designed. Usually, the database design is considered first and then ActiveRecord models are created with a near one-to-one mapping to database tables. Clean architecture turns that process upside down and has you consider your domain logic far ahead of the database.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOnce you have a test-driven domain object model that begins to fully model and implement your business rules, you can begin to focus on the interfaces that control the boundaries between the web and the actual domain logic.\r\n</p><h5><strong>Use Cases</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe interfaces that interact with the database, web, external services on the one side, and your domain entities on the other side, are called Use Cases. A use case can also be described as a User Story. A use case defines the interaction between a role and part of the system. There are special syntaxes for describing use cases, such as \r\n\t<a href=\"http://cukes.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Cucumber</a> steps. But in simple form a use case can be described in terms such as \u201ca user logging in\u201d, or \u201ca manager adding a new employee\u201d.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn Rails, use cases can be implemented through Interactor models that take request objects passed in through the controller and return response objects that get rendered in the view. The request and response objects are simple data structures with no behavior or logic. Interactors can thus interact with controllers, domain objects, and repositories.\r\n</p><h5><strong>Repositories</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tAt this point you may be thinking we\u2019re throwing all of Rails out. But we\u2019re not. In fact, we are going to keep on using ActiveRecord::Base as the base class for our repository models. The name repository implies a data store. So these repository models are responsible only for storing and retrieving data. We can use the full \r\n\t<a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html\" target=\"_blank\">Active Record query interface</a> if we want to, or drop down into plain SQL. It doesn\u2019t matter how we implement repositories as long as our dependencies point away from them. With inverted depencies our application is loosely coupled and we can freely refactor domain logic without caring about the implementation details of the persistence layer.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4292\" alt=\"clean_rails_diagram\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/clean_rails_diagram.png\" height=\"628\" width=\"600\">\r\n</p><h3>An Example in Rails</h3><p>\r\n\tWe tried this approach in a Rails app that had already been under development for a few months. The complexity of the domain led us to the decision to refactor away from the traditional Rails way towards this type of clean architecture. Immediately the benefits could be felt when running tests. The old tests were already taking about 30 seconds without too many cases. The new tests run in about a second and we can now freely add new ones without fear of slowing them down. Our domain logic was completely refactored from a database-centric one to a properly object-oriented one. This simplified the many table joins we had to do previously. Now we use object inheritance to group similar concepts and can get the behavior we need without complex database queries.\r\n</p><h5><strong>How it\u2019s Done</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tFirst, I started off in a new clean directory and added a lib/ and spec/. Using test-first development, I started creating entities. Entities are where all the domain logic lives. They inherit from a base class called Entity.\r\n</p><pre>class Entity\r\n  include ActiveModel::Validations\r\n  attr_accessor :id\r\n  def self.attr_accessor(*vars)\r\n    @class_attributes ||= [:id]\r\n    @class_attributes.concat vars\r\n    super(*vars)\r\n  end\r\n  def self.class_attributes\r\n    @class_attributes\r\n  end\r\n  def self.inherited(sublass)\r\n    sublass.attr_accessor(*@class_attributes)\r\n  end\r\n  def initialize(attr = {})\r\n    attr.each do |name, value|\r\n      send(\"#{name}=\", value)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\t<br>\r\n I\u2019m interested in the class and object attributes because it\u2019s convenient for validations.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNext, I implemented the Interactor base class.\r\n</p><pre>class Interactor\r\n  attr_reader :request, :response\r\n\r\n  def initialize(request = {})\r\n    @request = request\r\n    @response = Response.new\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  private\r\n\r\n  def save_repository(repo_class)\r\n    if @request.params[:id]\r\n      repo = repo_class.find(@request.params[:id])\r\n      repo.update_attributes(@request.object_attributes)\r\n    else\r\n      repo = repo_class.create(@request.object_attributes)\r\n    end\r\n    repo\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def delete(repo_class)\r\n    repo = repo_class.find(@request.params[:id])\r\n    repo.destroy\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\t<br>\r\nNotice there is a convenience method there used to save data into a repository. It can handle either create or update, depending on the params passed by the controller.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhat do the request and response objects look like?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThese have some behavior that make it easy to integrate Rails form helpers. For example, a response object that contains an id will be considered as a persisted record by a Rails form and so the form action will be the update url rather than the create url. They both are \r\n\t<a href=\"https://github.com/intridea/hashie\">Hashie::Mash</a> objects because that makes accessing attributes cleaner.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNow how does this integrate with Rails? It\u2019s simple. After I finished the basic domain object model and a couple of interactors, I dropped them into the Rails app directory. Be sure to add paths to entities and interactors in your autoload paths in config/application.rb. The application controller loads commonly used data attributes into every request:\r\n</p><pre>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base\r\n  before_filter :set_default_request\r\n\r\n  def current_account_id\r\n    @current_account_id ||= current_user.account_repository_id if user_signed_in?\r\n  end\r\n  helper_method :current_account_id\r\n\r\n  protected\r\n\r\n  def set_default_request\r\n    if current_user\r\n      @request = Request.new(current_user: current_user,\r\n                             current_account_id: current_account_id,\r\n                             params: params)\r\n    else\r\n      @request = Request.new(params: params)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tYou\u2019ll see there are still some ActiveRecord associations being used, partly in order to make \r\n\t<a href=\"https://github.com/plataformatec/devise\">Devise</a> work. A user belongs to an account and both have their data stored in repositories. So what does a repository look like? Very simple, no logic:\r\n</p><pre># == Schema Information\r\n#\r\n# Table name: user_repository\r\n#\r\n#  id                       :integer          not null, primary key\r\n#  account_repository_id    :integer\r\n#  first_name               :text\r\n#  last_name                :text\r\n#  state                    :text\r\n#  email                    :string(255)      default(\"\"), not null\r\n#  encrypted_password       :string(255)      default(\"\"), not null\r\n#  reset_password_token     :string(255)\r\n#  reset_password_sent_at   :datetime\r\n#  remember_created_at      :datetime\r\n#  sign_in_count            :integer          default(0), not null\r\n#  current_sign_in_at       :datetime\r\n#  last_sign_in_at          :datetime\r\n#  current_sign_in_ip       :string(255)\r\n#  last_sign_in_ip          :string(255)\r\n#\r\n\r\nclass UserRepository &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  self.table_name = 'user_repository'\r\n  belongs_to :account, class_name: 'AccountRepository', foreign_key: :account_repository_id\r\n  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tNow controllers simply route traffic and call interactors to perform the actual use cases:\r\n</p><pre>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\r\n  respond_to :html\r\n  before_filter :authenticate_user!\r\n\r\n  def user_params\r\n    params.require(:user).permit :first_name, :last_name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :phone\r\n  end\r\n  private :user_params\r\n\r\n  def index\r\n    @response = BrowseUsers.new(@request).call.extend(UserPresenter)\r\n    respond_with @response\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def show\r\n    @response = LoadUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response\r\n  end\r\n  alias_method :edit, :show\r\n\r\n  def new\r\n    @response = NewUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def create\r\n    @request.object_attributes = user_params\r\n    @response = SaveUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response.user, location: users_path\r\n  end\r\n  alias_method :update, :create\r\n\r\n  def destroy\r\n    @response = DeleteUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response, location: users_path\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\t<br>\r\n We make use of presenters to handle presentation details as well. The call method on an interactor instance always takes a @request object and returns a @response object which can be a nested data object. The views only know about what\u2019s in @response. It is the interactor\u2019s duty to get the data required for the view from the repository. Views know nothing about ActiveRecord, entities, or the database. Repositories know nothing about business rules or domain logic.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFinally, here\u2019s a set of interactors that can handle simple CRUD operations:\r\n</p><pre>class LoadLocation &lt; Interactor\r\n  def call\r\n    @response.location = location.attributes\r\n    @response\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def location\r\n    LocationRepository.joins(:manager)\r\n      .select(\"*, user_repository.name AS manager_name\")\r\n      .where(account_repository_id: @request.current_account_id)\r\n      .find(@request.params[:id])\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass LoadLocations &lt; Interactor\r\n  def call\r\n    @response.locations = locations\r\n    @response\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def locations\r\n    LocationRepository.joins(:manager)\r\n      .select(\"*, user_repository.name AS manager_name\")\r\n      .where(account_repository_id: @request.current_account_id)\r\n      .map(&amp;:attributes)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass SaveLocation &lt; Interactor\r\n  def call\r\n    location = Location.new(@request.object_attributes)\r\n    if location.valid?\r\n      repo = save_repository(LocationRepository)\r\n      @response.location = repo.attributes\r\n    else\r\n      @response.location = @request.object_attributes\r\n      @response.location.errors = location.errors\r\n    end\r\n    @response\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass DeleteLocation &lt; Interactor\r\n  def call\r\n    @response = delete(LocationRepository)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>\r\n\tThis is a very different way of doing things as far as Rails goes. It offers a clean boundary between application logic and implementation details. It would be quite easy to refactor an app like this into a Sinatra app. Or it could even use a different language for the delivery mechanism. External services should be easy to plugin. Likewise for database backends and ORMs. But most importantly, implementing a Rails app using a clean architecture reminds us to keep up the red-green-refactor TDD cycle and to make sure our models only have a single responsibility. Yes, it is more work this way but this is a case of not being penny wise and pound foolish. We can build seemingly powerful applications very quickly in Rails. But if we want to keep maintaining and refactoring and adding features for years, that initial productivity boost that Rails affords us will quickly run out and leave us with a big ball of mud.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tComment below with your thoughts. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\t<em>Cover image by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"><em>Alan Levine</em></a>\r\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tHaving been excited about Ruby on Rails since just after its 1.0 release back in late 2005, it\u2019s hard to imagine life without it. Whenever I come across a tangled knot of PHP or a Java beast my first response is \u201cI wish this was Rails.\u201d But by around 2010 there arose a potential challenger:</p><h3>Node.js</h3><p>\r\n\tWhen I first understood the benefits of asynchronous, event-driven flow I was really excited. It made perfect sense with analogies like the \r\n\t<a href=\"http://code.danyork.com/2011/01/25/node-js-doctors-offices-and-fast-food-restaurants-understanding-event-driven-programming/\">fast food restaurant</a>. So I got Node running and my first impression was \u201cwow, this is so much faster than Rails; I need to think about refactoring all my apps into Node\u201d. But it didn\u2019t take long to realize that wasn\u2019t going to work. Node.js was missing lots of the things I took for granted with Rails. Things like form helpers and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC architecture</a>. Now I\u2019m sure lots of people can respond with \u201cNode\u2019s got those\u2013look at X, Y and Z!\u201d I\u2019ve tried <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> and even <a href=\"http://railwayjs.com/\">Railway</a>. None of them seemed to just get things right the way Rails does. Rails is opinionated software that makes a lot of choices from the start. Not all of those choices are going to be correct, but there\u2019s nearly always a way to change the defaults. Moreover, all other things being equal, I\u2019m on the <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui\" target=\"_blank\">side of DHH</a> on preferring to code in Ruby over Javascript.</p><h3>Drawbacks to Rails</h3><p>\r\n\tRails is getting faster and more powerful all the time, but it\u2019s start up time is still quite slow. Its response time would benefit greatly if it used an asynchronous, event driven architecture, but that would require rewriting the entire framework and all its libraries\u2013never a good idea. You\u2019d lose all the synchronous advantages like simplicity of code, no need for callbacks, sequential execution, and ease of debugging.</p><h3>Faye to the Rescue</h3><p>\r\n\tSo how can we have our cake and eat it? \r\n\t<a href=\"http://faye.jcoglan.com/\">Faye</a> uses the powerful <a href=\"http://rubyeventmachine.com/\">EventMachine library</a> to bring event processing to Ruby. It wasn\u2019t hard to integrate with Ruby, especially thanks to Ryan Bates\u2019 handy <a href=\"https://github.com/ryanb/private_pub/\">PrivatePub</a> (<a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/316-private-pub\">Railscast</a>). So now we have both synchronous and asynchronous I/O living in the same app. How does this help? Forms and views can be written in the standard Rails way and server push notifications can be sent out at any time. Client events can trigger Rails actions that notify other clients of the changes \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://github.com/Flotype/now\">NowJS</a>.</p><h3>Other Options</h3><p>\r\n\tOther than Rails and Node, there are a few notable frameworks in other languages. Erlang is a good language choice because of its concurrency and making asynchronous development easier. \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.chicagoboss.org/\">Chicago Boss</a> and <a href=\"http://nitrogenproject.com/\">Nitrogen</a> both look like promising frameworks written in Erlang. Haskel enforces strict typing and automatically executes in a non-blocking manner and boasts the <a href=\"http://www.yesodweb.com/\">Yesod</a> web framework. Choosing these or other less mainstream languages may or may not pan out well depending on your organization\u2019s willingness to try new things.</p><h3>The Future</h3><p>\r\n\tSo what will the next generation of web frameworks be like? I don\u2019t see a clear winner here. Rails is excellent at building RESTful services and Node works great for client-heavy web apps. Rails\u2019 features will gradually get ported over to Node through packages such as Express and Railway. Node will influence Rails developers to consider event-driven architecture where they need it, such as push notifications and multi-user collaboration. Other languages will exert their influence and perhaps produce formidable challengers to Rails and Node. From a user\u2019s perspective a non-blocking asynchronous application seems faster as the UI can continue to accept input even while performing tasks on the server. So I do hope to see more emphasis in the Rails community on event-driven I/O.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

I\u2019m new to programming and I had the luxury of learning to program by letting tests drive my development.  This post is about learning TDD as a beginner.</p><p>Three weeks into my <a href=\"https://practicingruby.com/articles/tdd-costs-and-benefits\">Ruby on Rails training</a> I was bombarded with TDD.  Initially overwhelmed, I wrote it off as another set of syntax to learn with no real benefits. What\u2019s the point right? I\u2019ll know if my code doesn\u2019t work because, well...it won\u2019t work.  I was required to use TDD in the beginning of my training and the more I used it, the more I understood and appreciated the benefits.</p><p>Maintaining focus.  You have a problem, you start to solve it, and before you know it you\u2019re working on a totally different issue.  How do you know what you want to happen or when the problem is solved?  What do you want out of the code?  The tests will tell you!  These questions are the first ones you answer while writing your tests.  It forces you to plan first then write the code to make it do what you want later.  Baby steps is the name of the game when incrementally building solid code functionality. Write the tests that fail, do the simplest thing that works, and then move on to the next.  Programming this way really lets you focus on the creative part of the problem solving rather than getting caught up in trying to remember what you were doing.  TDD works as an outline to keep you focused and in your flow.</p><p><a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tddmeme.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4749\" alt=\"TDD meme\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tddmeme.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\"></a></p><p>The consumer of the software we build matters, right?  When you write tests you write them around exactly how the consumer will use the software, what you want them to experience, and what you want to happen.  The first thing you have to do is think about each step the consumer will take.  If you write strong tests, your code will be more solid, concise, and do what you want it to do.</p><p>The greatest gift TDD ever gave me was a deeper understanding of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC pattern</a>, which was a difficult concept for me to grasp as a new programmer; especially figuring out how they all work together and what each one is in charge of, I\u2019m still learning!  It\u2019s all part of the RED, GREEN, REFACTOR mantra.  When you write tests, you write them so that they will fail.  That failure will give you an error with clues about where in the program the problem is taking place.  Is it telling you it can\u2019t find the \u2018Submit\u2019 button? Well then you know you probably want to check the view to see if you have it there.  It gives you a starting point to solve the problem, an immensely beneficial aspect when trying to fix a broken program.</p><p>New to TDD?

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tThe relationship between humans and computers is largely one-sided, meaning that we use computers and not the other way around. The paradigm looks like this:</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/computers.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3020\" alt=\"computers\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/computers.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1000\"></a></p><p>\r\n\tAs software developers, it\u2019s our job to write programs that turn inputs into outputs. We do this by writing algorithms. You can think of an algorithm like a recipe. For example, the algorithm for \u201coutputting\u201d a peanut butter and jelly sandwich works like this:</p><h5>\r\n\t<strong>PB&amp;J Algorithm:</strong>\r\n</h5><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Get two slices of bread (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Get some peanut butter (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Get some jelly (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Get a knife (input)</li>\t\r\n<li>Use the knife to get some peanut butter and spread it onto one of the slices of bread</li>\t\r\n<li>Use the knife to get some jelly and spread it on the other piece of bread</li>\t\r\n<li>Take the piece of bread with jelly on it and put it on top of the piece of bread with peanut butter (with the jelly side touching the peanut butter side)</li></ol><p>\r\n\tEasy, right?</p><p>\r\n\tLet\u2019s try something a little more difficult. In the next example we\u2019re going to output a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit from an input measured in degrees Celsius</p><h5>\r\n\t<strong>Fahrenheit to Celsius Algorithm:</strong>\r\n</h5><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Get a temperature in degrees Celsius</li>\t\r\n<li>Subtract 32 from the temperature</li>\t\r\n<li>Multiply the temperature by 5/9</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIt turns out that computers are really good at following instructions. That\u2019s why computers are so great at doing things like:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Storing information</li>\t\r\n<li>Displaying information</li>\t\r\n<li>Finding \u201cneedles in haystacks\u201d</li></ul><p>\r\n\tBut what if we were to say, \u201cComputer, is this a good haircut?\u201d</p><h3>Human-based Computation for Haircuts</h3><p>\r\n\tWell as it turns out, there are a handful of approaches that we could use to solve this. We\u2019ll cover a few examples of how we could make a recipe to solve the problem.</p><h5><strong>The Classical Approach</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe first problem that you might notice is that a \u201cgood haircut\u201d is difficult to quantify. But if we put our mind to it, we might come up with a list of quantifiable traits that looks something like this:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Hair color</li>\t\r\n<li>Distribution of colors</li>\t\r\n<li>Tightness of edges</li>\t\r\n<li>Evenness</li>\t\r\n<li>Symmetry</li>\t\r\n<li>Amount of split-ends</li>\t\r\n<li>Smoothness of fit to shape of the head</li></ul><p>\r\n\tWe could then write an algorithm that looks like this:</p><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Get a picture of the haircut (i.e., convert the haircut into machine language)</li>\t\r\n<li>Analyze the pixels</li>\t\r\n<li>Quantify all traits as a function of those pixels</li>\t\r\n<li>Calculate a score based on how well the picture meets those traits</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIt may come as no surprise to you that this would be an incredibly difficult algorithm to program, and its accuracy would vary tremendously. As it turns out, computers are not very good at these kinds of tasks, so we scrap this approach and all of its second-cousins.</p><h5><strong>The Deterministic Approach</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tLet\u2019s assume for a second that we have unlimited time and resources. How would we solve the problem then?</p><p>\r\n\tWe could use an algorithm like this:</p><ol>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Ask everyone on Earth whether or not they like the haircut</li>\t\r\n<li>Record their answers as either 1\u2019s (yes), 0\u2019s (don\u2019t know) or -1\u2019s (no)</li>\t\r\n<li>Add all the responses together</li>\t\r\n<li>If the result of this summation is &gt; 0, it\u2019s a good haircut</li>\t\r\n<li>Otherwise, it\u2019s a bad haircut</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIn theory, this algorithm would always return the same result (like our Fahrenheit to Celsius algorithm). But in practice, this algorithm doesn\u2019t work because we don\u2019t have unlimited time and resources.</p><h5><strong>A Probabilistic Approach</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tOK, so this is where the fun begins. Let\u2019s assume that you just got a haircut. You\u2019re not sure what you think of it. But you paid $20, so you\u2019d like to find out whether it is good or not. How would you do it?</p><p>\r\n\tIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019d start by asking, \u201cMom, do you like my haircut?\u201d which she would answer with a resounding yes. But just to make sure, you ask someone else and log your results as follows:</p>\r\n<!--\r\n#first-example td, #second-example td{ border:1px solid #CCC; text-align:center; }\r\n--><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><table id=\"first-example\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<colgroup>\r\n<col width=\"*\">\r\n<col width=\"*\">\r\n<col width=\"*\">\r\n</colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td style=\"width: 33%;

This is called a probabilistic algorithm. Unlike the deterministic approach (where we ask everyone), this algorithm may return different results based on who we ask (and in what order we ask them).

So let\u2019s consider a few practical applications.</p><h5><strong>Galaxy Zoo</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://sdss.org\">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> used advances in imaging technology to collect pictures of millions of galaxies. The end result of the survey was a data set bigger than anything we had ever collected. Now imagine you\u2019re a graduate student in astronomy. As part of your PhD, you are put to the task of classifying as much of the collected data as possible. (Someone\u2019s got to do it and machines aren\u2019t accurate enough). If you don\u2019t sleep, you might be able to classify 10,000 galaxies per year. If we assume that there are one million objects to be classified, this would equate to 100 PhD man-years.</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://galaxyzoo.org\">GalaxyZoo</a> is a project that set out to solve this problem. The premise is simple. They ask regular folks like you and me to classify galaxies into either ellipses or spirals. With so many galaxies, you might expect that it would take years for visitors of the site to work through them all, but within 24 hours of launch they were receiving almost 70,000 classifications per hour. By the end of it\u2019s first year, more than 50 million classifications were received, contributed by more than 150,000 people. That means that each galaxy was seen by ~50 participants. And since one expert can be replaced by a number of non-experts, they were able to increase the level of accuracy in a fraction of the time.</p><h5><strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tHave you ever seen these squiggly characters when you fill out a form online?</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/recaptcha-example.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3052 aligncenter\" alt=\"recaptcha-example\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/recaptcha-example.gif\" width=\"314\" height=\"125\"></a></p><p>\r\n\treCAPTCHA is actually a way of using human computation to teach computers how to read while providing security against spammers.

Well the computer is relatively certain that it knows the word \u201cupon\u201d, and the word \u201cbetween\u201d is unknown. &nbsp;Thus, we have a consensus task of revealing what the word that we recognize as \u201cbetween\u201d actually is (e.g., good or bad haircut?). If enough people agree that the word is \u201cbetween\u201d the program stops asking and assumes that the word is, in fact, \u201cbetween\u201d.</p><p>\r\n\tBecause so many people use reCAPTCHA (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) &mdash; the program was able to translate the entire New York Times archive in a few months &mdash; (less than) one word at a time.</p><h3>Our Clients</h3><h5><strong>Dognition: Artificial Canine Intelligence</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tCan you name this man?</p><p>\r\n\t<img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://secularright.org/SR/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/B.-F.-Skinner.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"327\"></p><p>\r\n\tIf you said BF Skinner, give yourself a repeated slap in the face.</p><p>\r\n\tSkinner was psychology\u2019s original pessimist.

Well, that wasn&#39;t sending anything back to the Rails API. Every time I reloaded the browser, my beers were back in their original order. Let\u2019s fix that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EmberApp/app/controllers/ballot.js</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;\n\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\n  sortProperties: [&#39;weight&#39;],\n\n  actions: {\n    swap: function(line_item_id_1, line_item_id_2) {\n      var li1, li1_weight, li2, li2_weight;\n      li1 = this.model.get(&#39;line_items&#39;).findBy(&#39;id&#39;, line_item_id_1);\n      li2 = this.model.get(&#39;line_items&#39;).findBy(&#39;id&#39;, line_item_id_2);\n      li1_weight = li1.get(&#39;weight&#39;);\n      li2_weight = li2.get(&#39;weight&#39;);\n      li1.set(&#39;weight&#39;, li2_weight);\n      li2.set(&#39;weight&#39;, li1_weight);\n      return Ember.$.ajax({\n        url: &quot;/api/v1/ballots/&quot; + (this.model.get(&#39;id&#39;)) + &quot;/swap/&quot; + (li1.get(&#39;id&#39;)) + &quot;/&quot; + (li2.get(&#39;id&#39;)),\n        type: &#39;put&#39;\n      }).done(function() {}).fail(function() {\n        li1.rollback();\n        return li2.rollback();\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the addition of the AJAX call at the end of the <code>swap</code> action in the ballot controller. There is likely a cleaner and more Ember(y) way to do this, and I would love to hear it in the comments below; however, that call got the job done for me and it&#39;s good enough to finish out this drag and drop prototype. I opened my console and was pleased to see an AJAX PUT network request after a drop event. Let\u2019s set up our Rails API endpoint.</p>\n\n<h3>The Coupling</h3>\n\n<p>In my head, I know I want the interaction between my Ember and Rails apps to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code> ----------------                                      -------------------\n|                |   PUT: /api/v1/ballots/1/swap/1/2  |                   |\n| Ember Frontend |   ==============================&gt;  | Rails API Backend |\n|                |                                    |                   |\n ----------------                                      -------------------\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is <em>really</em> all we need. A single endpoint that says &quot;swap the weight of line item 1 and line item 2 on ballot 1.&quot; That way, we keep the data on our backend API in sync with that is going on in the Ember frontend.</p>\n\n<p>So, let\u2019s do a little Rails to get this all set up. We are going to generate a ballot controller, then update the routes to access the request to <code>/api/v1/ballots/:id/swap/:li1_id/:li2_id</code></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"sh\">$ rails g controller Api::V1::Ballots\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>config/routes.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">namespace :api do\n  namespace :v1 do\n    resources :ballots do\n      put &#39;/swap/:li1/:li2&#39;, to: &#39;ballots#swap&#39;\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then make yourself a controller action for swap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>app/controllers/ballots_controller.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">class Api::V1::BallotsController &lt; ApplicationController\n  respond_to :json\n\n  def swap\n    ballot = Ballot.find(params[:ballot_id])\n    ballot.swap(LineItem.find(params[:li1]), LineItem.find(params[:li2]))\n    if ballot.save\n      render json: {}\n    else\n      render status: 500\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lastly, I added this method to my <code>Ballot</code> model to handle swapping line items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>app/models/ballots.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">def swap(li1, li2)\n  li1_weight = li1.weight\n  li2_weight = li2.weight\n  li1.weight = li2_weight\n  li2.weight = li1_weight\n  li1.save &amp;&amp; li2.save\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So that should work well. Right?</p>\n\n<h3>Dealing with Rails CSRF</h3>\n\n<p>That AJAX PUT <strong>should</strong> have worked but our Rails API is throwing back a crazy error.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is going on now is that Rails is kicking back our request due to a missing CSRF token. Luckily, there is a CSRF ember npm package we can install that will handle setting the token in all our request headers.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"sh\">$ npm install --save rails-csrf\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once that is done running, update your <code>app.js</code> to include your new module and your <code>routes/index.js</code> to request the rails CSRF token before page load:</p>\n\n<p><strong>EmberApp/app/app.js</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;\nimport Resolver from &#39;ember/resolver&#39;;\nimport loadInitializers from &#39;ember/load-initializers&#39;;\nimport config from &#39;./config/environment&#39;;\n\nEmber.MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS = true;\n\nvar App = Ember.Application.extend({\n  modulePrefix: config.modulePrefix,\n  podModulePrefix: config.podModulePrefix,\n  Resolver: Resolver\n});\n\nloadInitializers(App, config.modulePrefix);\n\n//Initialize Rails CSRF\nloadInitializers(App, &#39;rails-csrf&#39;);\nimport { setCsrfUrl } from &#39;rails-csrf/config&#39;;\nsetCsrfUrl(&#39;api/v1/csrf&#39;);\n\n\nexport default App;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>EmberApp/app/routes/index.js</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;\n\nexport default Ember.Route.extend({\n  controllerName: &#39;ballot&#39;,\n\n  beforeModel: function() {\n    return this.csrf.fetchToken();\n  },\n\n  model: function() {\n    return this.store.find(&#39;ballot&#39;, 1);\n  },\n  setupController: function(controller, model){\n    controller.set(&#39;model&#39;, model);\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the addition of &quot;beforeModel.&quot; This will request the csrf token from the backend before every page load, but we are not done yet. We need to support this request to <code>/api/v1/csrf</code> in our Rails application.</p>\n\n<p>First, we add this line to our routes.rb file underneath the <code>:api</code> and <code>:v1</code> namespace declarations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>routes.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">get :csrf, to: &#39;csrf#index&#39;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we will generate a simple CSRF controller to handle this request.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"sh\">$ rails g controller Api::V1::Csrf index\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>csrf_controller.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">class Api::V1::CsrfController &lt; ApplicationController\n  def index\n    render json: { request_forgery_protection_token =&gt; form_authenticity_token }.to_json\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once that is complete. Restart your <code>rails server</code> then reload your Ember app. Now start dragging and dropping to modify your beer rankings. You should see that, on every drop event, an AJAX request is being sent back to the Rails application and updating the line items weights. Now, when you refresh your browser, your updates to beer rankings will be persisted!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>While it does take a <em>little</em> work to wire up a Rails/Ember application, they play quite well together! <a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/data\">Ember-Data&#39;s</a> near perfect compatibility with <a href=\"https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers\">ActiveModelSerializers</a> makes keeping your models up to date crazy simple. And, with the <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19832\">Rails API becoming a first class citizen with Rails 5</a>, I can see this flow becoming even <strong>easier</strong> in the coming future. So, if you are not a big fan of integrated frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/#!\">meteor</a> or <a href=\"http://www.voltframework.com/\">volt</a> than using Rails and Ember is a very elegant way to get a lot of work done fast!</p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli\">Part 1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli-part-2\">Part 2</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

We are going to generate a ballot controller, then update the routes to access the request to `/api/v1/ballots/:id/swap/:li1_id/:li2_id`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails g controller Api::V1::Ballots\r\n```\r\n\r\n**config/routes.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nnamespace :api do\r\n  namespace :v1 do\r\n    resources :ballots do\r\n      put '/swap/:li1/:li2', to: 'ballots#swap'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen make yourself a controller action for swap.\r\n\r\n**app/controllers/ballots_controller.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Api::V1::BallotsController < ApplicationController\r\n  respond_to :json\r\n\r\n  def swap\r\n    ballot = Ballot.find(params[:ballot_id])\r\n    ballot.swap(LineItem.find(params[:li1]), LineItem.find(params[:li2]))\r\n    if ballot.save\r\n      render json: {}\r\n    else\r\n      render status: 500\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, I added this method to my `Ballot` model to handle swapping line items.\r\n\r\n**app/models/ballots.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef swap(li1, li2)\r\n  li1_weight = li1.weight\r\n  li2_weight = li2.weight\r\n  li1.weight = li2_weight\r\n  li2.weight = li1_weight\r\n  li1.save && li2.save\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that should work well. Right?\r\n\r\n###Dealing with Rails CSRF\r\n\r\nThat AJAX PUT **should** have worked but our Rails API is throwing back a crazy error.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is going on now is that Rails is kicking back our request due to a missing CSRF token. Luckily, there is a CSRF ember npm package we can install that will handle setting the token in all our request headers.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install --save rails-csrf\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is done running, update your `app.js` to include your new module and your `routes/index.js` to request the rails CSRF token before page load:\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/app.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\nimport Resolver from 'ember/resolver';\r\nimport loadInitializers from 'ember/load-initializers';\r\nimport config from './config/environment';\r\n\r\nEmber.MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS = true;\r\n\r\nvar App = Ember.Application.extend({\r\n  modulePrefix: config.modulePrefix,\r\n  podModulePrefix: config.podModulePrefix,\r\n  Resolver: Resolver\r\n});\r\n\r\nloadInitializers(App, config.modulePrefix);\r\n\r\n//Initialize Rails CSRF\r\nloadInitializers(App, 'rails-csrf');\r\nimport { setCsrfUrl } from 'rails-csrf/config';\r\nsetCsrfUrl('api/v1/csrf');\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EmberApp/app/routes/index.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Ember from 'ember';\r\n\r\nexport default Ember.Route.extend({\r\n  controllerName: 'ballot',\r\n\r\n  beforeModel: function() {\r\n    return this.csrf.fetchToken();\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  model: function() {\r\n    return this.store.find('ballot', 1);\r\n  },\r\n  setupController: function(controller, model){\r\n    controller.set('model', model);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the addition of \"beforeModel.\" This will request the csrf token from the backend before every page load, but we are not done yet. We need to support this request to `/api/v1/csrf` in our Rails application.\r\n\r\nFirst, we add this line to our routes.rb file underneath the `:api` and `:v1` namespace declarations.\r\n\r\n**routes.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nget :csrf, to: 'csrf#index'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we will generate a simple CSRF controller to handle this request.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rails g controller Api::V1::Csrf index\r\n```\r\n\r\n**csrf_controller.rb**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Api::V1::CsrfController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    render json: { request_forgery_protection_token => form_authenticity_token }.to_json\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is complete. Restart your `rails server` then reload your Ember app. Now start dragging and dropping to modify your beer rankings. You should see that, on every drop event, an AJAX request is being sent back to the Rails application and updating the line items weights. Now, when you refresh your browser, your updates to beer rankings will be persisted!\r\n\r\n##Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile it does take a *little* work to wire up a Rails/Ember application, they play quite well together! [Ember-Data's](https://github.com/emberjs/data) near perfect compatibility with [ActiveModelSerializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) makes keeping your models up to date crazy simple. And, with the [Rails API becoming a first class citizen with Rails 5](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19832), I can see this flow becoming even **easier** in the coming future. So, if you are not a big fan of integrated frameworks like [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/#!) or [volt](http://www.voltframework.com/) than using Rails and Ember is a very elegant way to get a lot of work done fast!\r\n\r\n##Resources\r\n\r\n* [Part 1](http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli)\r\n* [Part 2](http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli-part-2)\r\n",

It's us that's been breaking it all these years by placing content in fixed-width containers.\u201d\r\n\t</p><p>\r\n\t\t&mdash; Viljami S. (@viljamis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viljamis/statuses/274949862620004352\">December 1, 2012</a>\r\n\t</p></blockquote><p>\r\n\tWelcoming &nbsp;a new &nbsp;year is as good a time as any for reflection, and there are few things on the Web more deserving of thoughtful contemplation than Responsive Web Design (RWD). Rivaled only by HTML5 in terms of buzzword status and pedestal placement, our mysterious stranger tore down most of the walls that \r\n\t<code>width: 960px;</code> built.</p><p>\r\n\tIn the resulting excitement, some developers hailed RWD as the saviour of us all, while others tried it and swore it off as a time-sink. Still others are waiting for RWD to blow over so we can get back to making websites.&nbsp;Additionally, device makers are coming to the same realization as everyone else &mdash; we are no longer constrained to an area the size of a sheet of paper. Amidst all the fuss, I noticed plenty of confusion about it at all levels.</p><h3>What Responsive Is.</h3><p>\r\n\tRWD is the idea and methodology behind creating websites that respond to the user\u2019s environment and behaviors. Screen size, device orientation, and resolution all factor into how the content is displayed to the user. The use of media queries, fluid grids, and flexible media all work together to provide an optimal viewing experience. Rather than multiple codebases for each target screen size, a single codebase serves all users.</p><p>\r\n\tMany have \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/responsive-web-design-guidelines-tutorials/#a2\" target=\"_blank\">defined</a>, <a href=\"http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-web-design-missing-the-point/\" target=\"_blank\">refined</a> and <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Responsive-Web-Design/What-is-responsive-design\" target=\"_blank\">enhanced</a> responsive\u2019s basic definition, but the following is all we really need to understand the approach. Media queries, fluid grids, and flexible media aren\u2019t just the trappings of a responsive website, they are the core techniques of the practice. Media queries allow the application of different CSS depending on screen dimensions and orientation. Fluid grids structure the site design around ratios rather than fixed values (i.e. 960px) and allow sites to conform to different screen sizes. Media assets adapt to device sizes allowing users a more complete experience regardless of how they access the site.</p><p>\r\n\tAnyone who built websites over the past year likely heard the above terms on a daily basis. However, responsive web design hasn\u2019t been the topic\r\n\t<em>&nbsp;du jour</em> for all that long. To help illustrate the recency of the responsive web conversation, I\u2019ve included Google Trends data on related terms below (embedded):</p><p>\r\n\tThe data doesn\u2019t exactly represent any peer-reviewed research, but you can get a feel for how long the terms have been relevant. Around May 2010 queries for RWD and its constituent terms really start to lift. Ethan Marcotte published \u201c\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\">Responsive Web Design</a>\u201d on <em>A List Apart</em> around the same time, drawing parallels to the architectural concept of the same name.</p><p>\r\n\tWhat\u2019s the point here? I can\u2019t think of the last project I worked on where a responsive website wasn\u2019t at least considered, if not actually included and launched. As a developer, responsive design is part of my day-to-day considerations, but the concept has only met wide discussion in the last few years and applied on a large scale for even less time. Yes, the Web moves fast but this isn\u2019t just a new coding technique or browser feature &mdash; what&nbsp;we\u2019re looking at&nbsp;is a fundamental shift in paradigms. An object\u2019s width is one of its most basic properties, and the width of the Web is changing.</p><h3>What Responsive Isn\u2019t.</h3><p>\r\n\tWith so many benefits to having a site that can dress for any occasion, why not just make that the norm and usher in a new, device-agnostic era on the Web? As an overly excited web developer, that was certainly my first impulse. However, responsive design isn\u2019t \u201cthe solution\u201d and depending on your situation it may not address any of your major problems.</p><p>\r\n\tIt really doesn\u2019t matter what numbers you \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406331,00.asp\">look</a> <a href=\"http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/insights/library/infographics/mobile-movement/\" target=\"_blank\">at</a>, mobile web use is up. Way up. All the way up. And traffic is only <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-520862.html\">slated to increase</a>. When the majority of users were on desktop browsers we could set a page\u2019s width to the narrowest of the target screen resolutions and be pretty safe. Now, a user might access your site not only on a smartphone, but from several different non-desktop devices <a href=\"http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/multi-screen_infographic.pdf\">in the course of completing a single task</a>.</p><p>\r\n\tUsers\u2019 changing usage patterns will impact any Web-bound project you start, therefore it\u2019s increasingly important to analyze your target audience before deciding on what approach to take. If your site analytics show that most visits come from IE8 workstations, no level of responsiveness will improve those users\u2019 experience. By the same token, if your primary demographic turns out to be tablet and mobile users, just adding a few media queries can vastly improve how your site renders on those devices.</p><p>\r\n\tThe key takeaway is that responsive design is a technique. It\u2019s not a framework, or a toolkit, or a plugin or anything else but a method of problem solving. Similar to all problem-solving techniques, responsive isn\u2019t suited for every problem. There are cases where having a separate mobile and desktop site is quicker, cheaper, or more effective than a responsive site that caters to every device. Smashing Magazine published an \r\n\t<a href=\"http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/22/separate-mobile-responsive-website-presidential-smackdown/\">in-depth comparison</a> of 2012\u2032s presidential candidates\u2019 mobile approaches (one responsive, one with a separate mobile site) to solving the same problem,&nbsp;that helps to underline the challenges inherent in both techniques.</p><h3>Where to now?</h3><p>\r\n\tRWD is arguably the most popular of several attempts to cope with and adapt to a changing problem space. Just think, if painters were only ever shown an 8.5\u00d711-inch canvas, then suddenly given a nearly infinite number of width and height combinations to work with, they too would need to take stock. They would likely need to reexamine everything they thought they knew about composition. Perhaps they would develop techniques for dealing with especially large or small canvases. Whatever the outcome, once the painters learned to deal with the new variable in their workflow, they would return to task: painting.</p><p>\r\n\tThe metaphor may be a little shaky since paintings usually don\u2019t have to \u201crespond\u201d to different canvas sizes, but I think the point stands. Every time the problem space changes, those who work within that space adapt their methods and continue producing. The need for responsive websites will not go away, but building a \u201cresponsive website\u201d instead of just a website is the same as building an \u201cgood SEO website\u201d or an \u201cHTML5 website\u201d. All these things are merely attributes, they are not the site itself.</p><p>\r\n\tIf web design is problem solving, every website is a solution to a specific problem. How effectively a particular site solves the problem has nothing to do with which framework or how many media queries it uses. Instead, a site\u2019s effectiveness relies on how carefully its developer chooses its constituent components and how well those components work together to address the original problem.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

Exploring the history and development of the Porsche lineage from the 1930s to today, the exhibit featured dozens of cars, accompanied by videos and photographs, that helped the team to reflect on the experience engendered by their singular design and engineering. The following are our design team\u2019s thoughts and reactions upon visiting the exhibit</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/porsche_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4711 aligncenter\" alt=\"porsche_1\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/porsche_1.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"470\"></a></p><h5 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<strong>Dante (Director of User Experience)</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn the surface, there are two obvious themes running through the Porsche by Design exhibit: 1) precision design and engineering and 2) the emotional connection between machine and operator. The vehicles were, of course, striking, but the part of the exhibit that most resonated with me were the accompanying photographs of engineers, factory workers, and the Porsche family, themselves. It\u2019s interesting how we glorify beautiful objects, while somehow forgetting that flesh and blood human beings actually conceived of, designed, and built the objects. Their humanity and vision drove their craft and set their creations apart. Just as important to me were the people to whom these cars belonged. Again, these were real, live people with a passion (sometimes an obsession) for a particular feeling that only a Porsche could give them. I, personally, am a \r\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mopar\">Mopar</a> man, but those cars weren\u2019t built for me. They weren\u2019t built for my grandma and they weren\u2019t built based on a persona created by a research department. They were built for Porsche drivers, a market that didn\u2019t exist until the first Porsches started rolling out of the workshop.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo why did that move me? Why is it important at all? It\u2019s simple \u2013 if a group of men created enduring beauty that speaks to something in the hearts of other men, then so could I. That\u2019s maybe the most trite, cliche thing I\u2019ve ever written, but it\u2019s a desire that I\u2019ve felt is sometimes lacking in the user experience field. There\u2019s a tendency to design based solely on convention, frameworks, and the insights of a select few \u201cthought leaders\u201d. That\u2019s a great way to deliver something that won\u2019t fail, but should avoiding failure be your goal as a UX professional? Or should it be to innovate and inspire wherever possible? Should you make important decisions based on research that\u2019s been abstracted and extrapolated to the point of losing all basis in reality, or should you rely on your instinct, your gut? I know that there\u2019s a place for plug-n-chug, and I\u2019m not one to reinvent the wheel, but it\u2019s incumbent on us to take every opportunity to inject our humanity into the products that we build. If your average UX team is comfortable building Honda Civics for a wide swath of people to be completely stupefied by, that\u2019s great. There\u2019s a place for that. Me, I want to build Porsches.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/porsche_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4712 aligncenter\" alt=\"porsche_2\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/porsche_2.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"470\"></a></p><h5 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<strong>Lucas (User Experience)</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tEach model, from the \r\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_356\">356</a> (first produced in 1948) all the way up to more recent <a href=\"http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/\">911</a> models, was both unique and also connected to the overall evolution of Porsche design. Frame and body design, headlight housing, interior cabins, exhaust systems, paint jobs, etc., varied greatly between models, but you always knew you were looking at a Porsche. It seemed each design achieved a high level of style and character primarily through the exceptional care taken to exceed functional requirements. By artfully meeting functional needs and working with strong overall design foundations of the Porsche brand, designers were able to go in bold new directions. The evolution of design within the Porsche line seemed to serve as a foundation for the transition to new and innovative designs. In the following <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/78937043\">video</a>, Daniel Weil does a great job of articulating&nbsp;the thought process that&nbsp;designers go through as a product design is developed and refined over time. Although the product is extremely different (in Weil\u2019s case it is a baby bottle), the overall care taken to address functional requirements is not unlike Porsche design.</p><h5 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<strong>Doug (Design)</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe thing that stuck out to me the most when our team visited the NC Art Museum\u2019s Porsche By Design exhibit was the elegant simplicity of some of the earlier models of Porsches. The colors were classic, the curves were refined, the details were subtle, and the racing liveries were bold. In my opinion, the older models felt like they were a lot more in line with the designers\u2019 initial visions even keeping in mind the fact that times have changed, technology has changed, and that design trends have come and gone.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tI think it was Da Vinci who said, \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u201d Porsche has always created amazing cars, but those earlier models were really amazing. Stripped of, or altogether void of, the amenities and nice-to-haves that are commonplace on today\u2019s cars (I don\u2019t think I saw a single cup holder in the exhibit). They had a unified and balanced feel to them. Getting to see all of these cars was really inspirational and it got me thinking about the work that I do. It seems all too common today to jam-pack cars, web pages, logos, songs, you name it, with far too much unnecessary&hellip;stuff. So whether we\u2019re talking about features, content, colors, elements, or shiny distractions, the most memorable solutions are often the most simple. /rant</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAll in all though, this exhibit was awesome. It was really cool to see all of these cars and some of the concept cars that never made it to production.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-6.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-4720 aligncenter\" alt=\"photo (6)\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-6.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"423\"></a></p><h5 dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<strong>Raleigh (Director of Design)</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhen thinking about \u201cdesign\u201d at Smashing Boxes we do not just think about how something looks.

When I say \u201cdesigned,\u201d I am not referencing just the outer body of the car, which is by the way, very pleasing to the eye. I am talking about the overall car itself.

If you have any\nquestions then please feel free to post them in the comments bellow. :)</p>\n\n<p>Once you have your API built out, you should have the following 2 endpoints ready that your Ember app can talk to.\n<code>\nPUT    /api/v1/ballots/:ballot_id/swap/:li1/:li2(.:format)\nGET    /api/v1/ballots/:id(.:format)\n</code>\nAll we will be doing is getting a ballot and swapping the line_items on that ballot when we drag a beer over another beet. Super simple!</p>\n\n<h2>Ember</h2>\n\n<p>Now the good stuff.

I like to setup my adapter and generate my models first. For this\nblog post we will be using <a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/data\">ember-data</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"sh\">$ ember generate adapter application\n$ ember generate model Ballot\n$ ember generate model LineItem\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Update your generated <code>EmberApp/app/adapters/application.js</code>. We will need to update our adaptor namespace to <code>/api/v1</code>. Then we need to tell Ember to use the ActiveModelAdapter. Ember, out of the box, knows how to communicate with a Rails app using ActiveRecordSerializers. We will also tell it the namespace of our api.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import DS from &#39;ember-data&#39;;\n\nexport default DS.ActiveModelAdapter.extend({\n  namespace: &#39;api/v1&#39;,\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now open the generated <code>EmberApp/app/models/line-item.js</code> model to find a lot of ember-cli generated javascript!\nWe used to have to do all this tedious work to wire up our models by hand, but now ember-cli handles\nall this for us. All we need to do is define the attributes for a line item.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import DS from &#39;ember-data&#39;;\n\nexport default DS.Model.extend({\n  beer_name: DS.attr(&#39;string&#39;),\n  weight: DS.attr(&#39;number&#39;),\n  ballot: DS.belongsTo(&#39;ballot&#39;),\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ballot will be a little bit different. We are going to use a computed property called <code>sorted_line_items</code> to sort the ballot&#39;s line-items\nby weight. This will be important since we want to be able to re-arrange the sorted list of beers. Open\n<code>EmberApp/app/models/ballot.js</code> and update the js with the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import DS from &#39;ember-data&#39;;\n\nexport default DS.Model.extend({\n  line_items: DS.hasMany(&#39;line_items&#39;),\n\n  sorted_line_items: (function(){\n    return this.get(&#39;line_items&#39;).sortBy(&#39;weight&#39;);\n  }).property(&#39;line_items.@each.weight&#39;),\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, generate a ballot controller and a line-item view. These don&#39;t need to be modified yet.\n<code>sh\n$ ember generate controller Ballot\n$ ember generate view LineItem\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will create an index route.\n<code>sh\n$ ember generate route index\n</code></p>\n\n<p>This will generate an <code>EmberApp/app/routes/index.js</code> route file and <code>index.hbs</code> handlebars template. We&#39;ll now go into these\nfiles and define what controller and model we will want to use.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js\">import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;;\n\nexport default Ember.Route.extend({\n  controllerName: &#39;ballot&#39;,\n\n  model: function() {\n    return this.store.find(&#39;ballot&#39;, 1);\n  },\n\n  setupController: function(controller, model){\n    controller.set(&#39;model&#39;, model);\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we will define a simple view at <code>EmberApp/app/templates/index.hbs</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"handlebars\">&lt;div class=&#39;container&#39;&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&#39;container&#39;&gt;\n    &lt;ol&gt;\n      {{#each controller.model.sorted_line_items}}\n        &lt;li&gt;\n          {{beer_name}}\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n      {{/each}}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Rails</h2>\n\n<p>The Rails side of this application is pretty simple. A single controller, for getting ballots and a basic model structure that looks like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code> --------            ----------           ------\n|        |  1  0..* |          |  1    1 |      |\n| Ballot | &lt;======= | LineItem | ======&gt; | Beer |\n|        |          |  weight  |         | name |\n --------            ----------           ------\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A little <code>rails generate</code> <em>magic</em> should get us pretty far.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"sh\">$ rails g model Ballot\n$ rails g model Beer name:string\n$ rails g model LineItem ballot:references beer:references weight:integer\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I just made a tiny ballot in my seeds that we can use to play with for this app</p>\n\n<p><strong>db/seeds.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">Beer.delete_all\nBallot.delete_all\n\nb1 = Beer.create!(name: &#39;Goose Island IPA&#39;)\nb2 = Beer.create!(name: &#39;Dogfish Head 90 Min IPA&#39;)\nb3 = Beer.create!(name: &#39;Mother Earth Oatmeal Stout&#39;)\nb4 = Beer.create!(name: &#39;Raleigh Brewing Mocha Stout&#39;)\n\nBallot.create!(beers: [b1, b2, b3, b4], user_id: 1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lastly, I created a BallotsController and route so that my Ember app has a ballot that it can grab from the Rails app.</p>\n\n<p><strong>app/controllers/api/v1/ballots_controller.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">class Api::V1::BallotsController &lt; ApplicationController\n  respond_to :json\n\n  def show\n    render json: Ballot.first\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>app/serializers/ballot_serializer.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">class BallotSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer\n  embed :ids, include: true\n  attributes :id\n  has_many :line_items, serializer: LineItemSerializer\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>config/routes.rb</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">Rails.application.routes.draw do\n  namespace :api do\n    namespace :v1 do\n      resources :ballots\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once that is done, initialize a Rails server...</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ rails s\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...and then initialize your Ember app via ember-cli but you will need to tell ember to talk to <code>localhost:3000</code> which <em>should</em> be where your rails app is hosted at.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once your ember server is up and running, point your browser to <code>localhost:4200</code> and you will see this. <strong>Dont forget to seed your database!</strong>\n<img src=\"http://cl.ly/image/1e1D0m0J161V/Image%202014-12-03%20at%209.53.45%20AM.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/smashingboxes/blog-mergin_rails_ember_cli\">App Repo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ember-cli.com/\">ember-cli</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/merging-rails-and-ember-cli-part-2\">In part two</a>, I&#39;ll go into detail about how I implemented HTML5 drag-n-drop functionality for updating beer rankings.

It wasn't all bad at first but as ember-cli started to become the de-facto standard for new Ember apps I felt myself getting left in the dust. Once I heard that ember-cli was going to become a first class citizen in Ember v2 I decided to quit dragging my feet and get on board with the new way to build Ember apps.",

After graduating from Temple University in 2009, she sent out demo reels to news stations across the country with no luck. While continuing to look for jobs in her field, she made money by bartending and taking on side jobs such as selling real estate, none of which made use of her degree. \u201cA lot of the jobs I was applying for required skills I didn\u2019t have so I took a web design certification program to acquire them. I fell head over heels in love with technology,\u201d says Nauman. She thought she might be able to teach herself to code, but knew it would take considerable time and would be hard to learn that way. \u201cI wanted to be immersed.\u201d\r\n</p><p id=\"attachment_4877\" style=\"margin-left: 8px; text-align: center;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lindsay.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4877 \" alt=\"Lindsay Nauman\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lindsay.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;\"></a>Lindsay Nauman, a graduate of Launch Academy in Boston\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tEnter code school; one solution to help close the employment gap and bring motivated individuals an opportunity for career growth. Offering crash courses in high-demand software languages, code schools give non-developers an opportunity to secure a better job with their new programming skills. Typically three months in length, they combine teaching and mentorship with real world development work. \u201cSuccessful schools center their curriculum around practical application\u201d says Eric Dodds of \r\n\t<a href=\"http://theironyard.com/academy/\" target=\"_blank\">The Iron Yard Academy</a> , a nationally respected code academy based out of Greenville, S.C. \u201cBy the end, students emerge as professional, junior-level programmers.\u201d Nauman and Miller are both graduates of a code school, and they\u2019ve found their lives transformed by it.\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCode academies, when done right, are profoundly challenging. \u201cThe information I read about the code school described the academy as boot camp style and super intense,\u201d recalls Nauman who attended \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.launchacademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Launch Academy</a> in Boston. \u201cI completely underestimated what that meant. I have always been able to pick things up quickly so I was like, I\u2019ve got this! It was the hardest, but most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done. I spent easily 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week in school or studying; basically eating, sleeping, and breathing code. It was much harder than I expected.\u201d\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMiller, who attended The Iron Yard Academy, agrees, \u201cIt was overwhelming at first. There were lots of long and stressful nights of coding, and I definitely questioned my ability at times. But, as the program progressed, all of the pieces started falling together.\u201d\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAfter completing intensive three month courses, neither graduate had trouble finding a programming job. \u201cThere were a lot of opportunities for junior software developers,\u201d says Nauman. \u201cI had a ton of interviews, and second interviews. Once you have the skills, the hard part isn\u2019t getting the interviews, it\u2019s making sure you find a company that is a good cultural fit for you. One that encourages continual learning.\u201d She now works as a back-end developer for Smashing Boxes.\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMiller was able to secure a job as an Interaction Engineer at \r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.benefitfocus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Benefitfocus</a> by showcasing <a href=\"http://alisonelizabeth.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">her portfolio </a>on GitHub. \u201cI landed about ten interviews and received three job offers within the first month after completing the program,\u201d says Miller.\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBoth Miller and Nauman have seen their salaries double since graduating from the program and accredit their success to code school. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to expect when I decided to enroll in The Iron Yard Academy,\u201d says Miller, \u201cI was taking a leap, both personally and financially. It definitely paid off. I feel like I have a great career path ahead of me.\u201d\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNauman couldn\u2019t agree more, \u201cI sometimes stand back and can\u2019t believe this is my life right now. I was bartending and now I\u2019m a software developer at one of the coolest companies ever, working with and learning from such smart people, doing something that excites and challenges me on a daily, no, an hourly basis.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tWhen I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/heroku-vs-amazon-web-services/\">Heroku and Amazon Web Services</a> a few months ago it seemed both services were equally worthwhile in many respects. My rule of thumb was: small app\u2013Heroku; large app\u2013Amazon. Since then a few events have caused me to reevaluate my position.</p><h3>Heroku\u2019s customer non-service</h3><p>\r\n\tRecently, Heroku revealed a new site interface. In the past if you needed something you could open up a free support ticket. Now the only options for free support are the docs or <a title=\"Stack Overflow\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/heroku\">Stack Overflow</a>. Yes, they actually link to Stack Overflow on their <a title=\"Help page\" href=\"https://help.heroku.com/\">new help page</a>. Ticket History is still visible, but there is no way to open up a new ticket.</p><p>\r\n\tGranted, AWS doesn\u2019t provide much more than Heroku. But AWS does have a free forum where Amazon employees reply to users\u2019 support questions.</p><p>\r\n\tI recently had an issue related to billing with Heroku. Heroku offered a beta period for their new database stack allowing developers to try out their new databases free of charge. I added a couple for testing believing they would remain free until their general release in August. Heroku\u2019s&nbsp;<a title=\"blog post\" href=\"https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/5/3/crane_the_new_50_per_month_production_database_/\">blog post</a> indicated they would notify users prior to billing them.</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Selection_032.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1600\" title=\"Heroku July newsletter\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Selection_032-300x169.png\" alt=\"Heroku July newsletter\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"></a></p><p>\r\n\tI assumed there would be an additional step needed to opt-in before being billed, but this was not the case. The only notice I found was a note in one of their email newsletters (which I never read). The notice was one sentence in the middle of the email (underlined in red).</p><p>\r\n\tNearly two months later, I discovered we had accumulated several hundred dollars in charges for databases that we weren\u2019t even using. I tried writing them back at their billing@heroku.com account, but it\u2019s been three weeks and I have not received a response.</p><h3>How AWS would have prevented this</h3><p>\r\n\tAround the same time that I noticed the excessive Heroku charges, I logged into our AWS account. What a pleasant surprise to be greeted with a message telling me how to set up notifications for estimated cost triggers. (I already use Amazon\u2019s <a title=\"SNS\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">Simple Notification Service</a> for CPU usage alerts on our EC2 instances.) The alerts are easy to configure due to an intuitive web interface. After establishing a preferred trigger, you can review the past few days\u2019 activity which shows when the trigger would have activated. I immediately set up cost alerts for my AWS account. AWS was nice enough to place the cost alert feature in a prominent place where everyone should see it. Heroku may have a similar feature, but I have not found it.</p><p>\r\n\tThe billing issue is a small concern, but it illustrates how mature AWS has become while Heroku\u2019s new interface is somewhat of a regression. In the future I will explore how to get up and running on AWS, and how to leverage Ruby gems to achieve similar functionality to that offered by Heroku.</p><p><em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

This allows physicians, care teams and coaches to make prescriptive decisions quickly and from anywhere.</p><p><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDMvMzAvMjEvMTYvMjQvMTM0LzcwNjk1Nzg5NTNfNDE0MzVlMzhiMV96LmpwZyJdXQ/7069578953_41435e38b1_z.jpg?sha=86ef8702\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Biometric sensors embedded in clothing. Photo Credit: Keoni Cabral</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><br></em></p><p>\r\n\tDr. David Berkoff, Sports Medicine Physician at UNC Department of Orthopaedics explains. \u201cOne of the main objectives right now is to improve continuity of care,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently we get a very inconsistent snapshot of a patients health. They come in for a visit, we review the data presented that day and make decisions.\u201d According to Dr. Berkoff, \u201cwith \u2018wearables\u2019 we are close to having continuous, accurate data about an individual's physiology and daily behaviors. This is key to empowering healthcare professionals to make better decisions and help drive behavior change and outcomes.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\t<strong><em>Personalized Wearables</em></strong></p><p>\r\n\tWhat is it: \u2018Made to fit\u2019 sensor-enabled apparel and medical devices that use advances in 3D printing technology to personalize the experience for an individual.</p><p>\r\n\tAccording to a <a href=\"http://qz.com/315924/the-patented-nike-shirt-that-could-track-your-heart-rate-and-blood-pressure-while-you-exercise\">recent article in Quartz</a>, Nike is using advances in nano-technology to embed sensors in their apparel. This combined with the ability to print an individual t-shirt with a 3D enabled printer will allow people to customize their apparel. Athletes and coaches will better understand when they are overtraining or under-training, and when they are under hydrated and overstressed. It will also reduce the cost of production and management of the supply chain for companies like Nike.</p><p><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDMvMzAvMjEvNDIvMTUvMzM1Lzc2NTAzNjI1NTZfM2YxZmZhMDZkZV96LmpwZyJdXQ/7650362556_3f1ffa06de_z.jpg?sha=383fed75\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo Credit: Atos</em></p><p>\r\n\tSensor-embedded 3D printing will also impact the medical device industry. Mayo Clinic has already produced its <a href=\"http://hitconsultant.net/2014/04/01/the-future-of-3d-printing-in-healthcare/\">first custom hip</a>. They are looking for ways to embed sensors in the devices to improve monitoring of a patient's function and wear and tear on the joint.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong><em>Active Coaching</em></strong></p><p>\r\n\tWhat is it: Sensor-embedded hardware and apparel that monitor performance, provide interpretation and make suggestions on how to progress. This next step in wearable technology will help individuals improve everything from their fitness to their biomechanics (posture and gait for example).</p><p>\r\n\tOne of the keys for active coaching to be successful is to improve the validity of the data and interpretation. Dr. Steven LeBoeuf, Founder and President of Valencell says, \u201cone reason we started with optical signal sensor based technology in the ear was the validity of the data.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tThe next step, according to LeBoeuf is to make the data relevant to improve engagement. \u201cWe need good data and then software that accurately interprets the data and provides useful advice on how to progress to make a dent in improving health and fitness outcomes.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\t<strong><em>Gesture Based Interfacing</em></strong></p><p>\r\n\tWhat is it: Empowers individuals to use gestures and other natural movements to interplay with devices. By adopting everyday movements and gestures in lieu of complex machine based tasks, we can improve the user experience and make it easier for people to onboard to new devices and software.</p><p><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDMvMzAvMjEvMzQvNDcvODU1Lzg3NDczNzYzNzBfY2VlNTFmMWM4YV96LmpwZyJdXQ/8747376370_cee51f1c8a_z.jpg?sha=6583961a\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\r\n\tWe\u2019ve already seen the beginning of gesture-based interfacing with Google Glass which lets users take a picture by blinking. Photo Credit: CyberHades</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p>According to \r\n\t<a href=\"http://wallstcheatsheet.com/technology/apple/apple-patent-outlines-intelligent-gesture-based-user-interface.html/?a=viewall\">recent patents from Apple</a>, their new Watch may allow for gesture-based adaptive learning. This may communicate actions like navigating through Apple TV, flipping pages on your iPad while running on a treadmill, shutting off the lights, and more.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong><em>Authenticated You</em></strong></p><p>\r\n\tWhat is it: Wearables have the ability to provide a unique signature to the individual. Using unique characteristics such as heart rhythm could take the place of outdated credentialing methods like a written password.</p><p>\r\n\tHow many times have you forgotten your password or had your email hacked? This could soon be a problem of the past. New technologies like watch-enabled heart rate monitors can measure one\u2019s unique rhythm and convert it to a password. Other companies are creating ingestibile technology that allows external devices to log in when the individual is near. Acid in the stomach powers the battery.</p><h3>Barriers To Success</h3><p>\r\n\tAccording to <a href=\"http://www.juniperresearch.com/viewpressrelease.php?pr=476\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">a report from Juniper Research</a>, the wearable tech market is expected to expand rapidly within the next few years. The firm projects that the wearable tech market will hit $4.5 billion by the end of 2014, and reach $53.2 billion by 2019. This is great news for OEMs who are investing heavily in wearable tech initiatives. However, several things need to fall into place in order for this market opportunity to achieve its full potential.</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Increased Battery Life</li>\t<li>Improved User Experience</li>\t<li>Making Data Useful</li></ul><h3>Death By Discharge</h3><p>\r\n\tOne of the key issues challenging wearable device engagement at the six month mark is the inconvenience of having to charge it. According to LeBoeuf, industry statistics show that as soon as someone takes off the device there is a more than one third chance they won\u2019t put it back on.</p><p>\r\n\t\u201cWhen you have to take your device off to charge it, you immediately disengage the user and they begin to wonder how much value they are getting by counting steps.\u201d This is what LeBoeuf calls \u201cdeath by discharge.\u201d \u201cIf their experience with the device is a good one, then they will likely put it back on but if not it may become best friends with the underwear drawer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\r\n\tDr. Berkoff agrees. \u201cAs an athlete, it\u2019s one of my biggest frustrations...I\u2019m ready to go on a long ride and I forgot to charge my device,\u201d he said. He also sees battery life as a big barrier to getting regular joes to purchase the devices, \u201cIf it\u2019s a problem for early adopters, then you know it\u2019s going to be an issue for everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tOrganizations like <a href=\"http://assist.ncsu.edu/\">Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies(ASSIST)</a> at North Carolina State University are working on solving the battery life issue. They are developing technologies to enable battery free and body powered devices. Tom Snyder, Industry Liaison for ASSIST explains, \u201cwe are utilizing nanotechnology to bring the energy requirement for sensors and wireless data transmission down to a level that your body can be utilized as a power supply.\u201d As an example, ASSIST materials, embedded in a textile can harvest energy from the temperature difference between the skin and air, and use this to power the sensors. This not only has an impact on clothing but also on medical devices. They\u2019re currently working on a battery free pacemaker.</p><h3>Human-Centered Design Will Be Key</h3><p>\r\n\tMarrying a relevant user experience with the appropriate interface will be key. Sensors embedded in a shirt to free up space coupled with a watch interface that delivers the information from clothing is one example. Another example of providing a good user experience is embedding technology in devices that are familiar, like headphones.</p><p>\r\n\t\u201cWe started with headphones because our audience were athletes and weekend warriors,\u201d said LeBoeuf. \u201cThey already wore headphones when they worked out so it made sense. Why make them work harder and purchase another device?\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tAccording to an industry report by <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/RockHealth/the-future-of-biosensing-wearables-by-rockhealth)\">Rock Health</a>, a health incubator and fund based in San Francisco, California, one of the biggest barriers to engagement is at the onset of using the device. Meaning, quite literally, the pain of getting it out of the box and setting it up. Reports indicate that close to 10 percent of technology products are returned before they are even used.</p><p>\r\n\tFashion is also an important element in adoption; it\u2019s about both form and function. Technology software and hardware designers are not accustomed to the nuances of fashion design. Consider the success of the smartphone, given it is typically stuffed in our pockets. If wearables are to succeed, brands must immerse themselves in fashion trends and psychology to inspire design.</p><h3>Getting Personal</h3><p>\r\n\tIn 2013, over 70 million wearable devices were sold and <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2913318\">by 2016 that number will reach over 90 million</a>. With that said, the adoption rate will slow or decline if these devices don\u2019t provide more meaning and context about how to improve our health, fitness, and life based upon our goals and needs.</p><p>\r\n\tTo truly connect the data, simplifying the communication between devices through a universal API will become critically important. It will start when devices talk to each other. Thanks to your phone\u2019s G.P.S., RFID, or Bluetooth, you\u2019ll get a personalized workout plan the second you arrive at the gym and adjust the intensity based upon your previous workout, cortisol levels and hydration. The device will know that it took longer for you to fall into REM sleep because home sensors indicate that you kept the lights on.</p><p>\r\n\tA number of companies including Nike are already moving towards coach-enhanced apps that learn from your performance outputs and adjusts your next workout accordingly. Apple\u2019s new health and fitness app will tell you when you need to stand or move more (two keys to cardiovascular health) based upon real time information from their Watch. In addition to Apple and Nike, a number of other companies are hiring teams of exercise physiologists, data scientists, and physicians to help move data from descriptive to prescriptive.</p><p>\r\n\tDr. Berkoff agrees that for devices to be adopted by the mainstream they have to provide more than just entertaining data to the user. \u201cPhysicians and their patients need to understand how they are progressing and if there is the need for an intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cData is just data without proper interpretation and there may be times where the physicians don\u2019t have time during a clinic visit to interpret the data. We just need to know when to connect with the patient.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tDr. Berkoff says that sports medicine physicians, physical therapists and other healthcare professionals can benefit from the continuous monitoring and interpretation of movement. \u201cI can only get so much information in a 10-15 minute office visit,\u201d he explained. \u201cI may watch someone walk or run during that visit, but they may be on their best behavior giving me less than perfect data. To really understand how they move and to make the best prescription we would benefit from continuous monitoring and feedback which we could then use to provide the patient with a better plan on how to progress and improve.\u201d</p><h3>The Future Is Already Here...Sort Of</h3><p>\r\n\tCompanies and startups are already creating new ways to measure health and performance and help people be more productive. Parents and their children are finding significant value in products like <a href=\"https://www.sqord.com/\">Sqord</a> - the first wearable for kids that helps curb childhood obesity and improve children\u2019s health. It uses sensors to track activity and provides feedback and motivation to help kids move more.</p><p>\r\n\tCompanies like <a href=\"http://www.fitlinxx.net/\">Fitlinxx</a> are also changing the game with their new product, AmpStrip. The heart rate and activity tracking monitor is designed to stick to the wearer\u2019s torso and be left for a week or more at a time. Once they\u2019re done with it, they can remove it like a bandaid and recharge, add adhesive and put it back on.</p><p>\r\n\tWhile wearable technology is still in its infancy, the growth and excitement around them will ensure the technology matures rapidly over the next few years.  </p>",

        "body": "<p>As an agency who provides work for hire services to build web and mobile applications, we often encounter a tug-of-war between ourselves and our clients concerning feedback loops. Feedback can take many forms, but in our world it comes as a result of getting apps into users\u2019 hands. Project stakeholders, fellow employees, and even customers are part of the feedback ecosystem. They are all capable of giving quality, measurable feedback on an application during its design and development. Feedback allows our team and clients insight into our products that are otherwise unavailable when a project is merely a concept. Armed with insights, the path to deploying a successful application becomes clearer and the client\u2019s investment generates a higher return. Both are possible because the development teams work on what matters most to the project. The result is delivering end users the features that matter most to them.</p><p><a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Print.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2036\" title=\"The Ideal Feedback Loop\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Print.jpg\" alt=\"Fisch's sketch of the ideal feedback loop\" width=\"371\" height=\"210\"></a></p><p>If feedback loops are so great, then why the antagonism? Typically the answer is budget. Most often startups, non-profits, and Fortune 1000s source their products to us because they don\u2019t have the internal expertise or bandwidth to compete the project. Our clients don\u2019t just want hours of development time, they want a finished product which serves the needs of their organization. Usually, project funding is dependent on deliverables that funding will obtain. While our project leaders and stakeholders understand that dollars equal deliverables, the powers behind the purse strings sometimes do not.</p><p>The issue at hand is not that feedback will destroy a budget. Rather, it is that feedback whether positive or negative may shift the deliverables given the constraints of time and budget. The shift in deliverables is where our clients run into problems with their financiers. Of course feedback does not only impact our clients. Certain types of feedback may slow our development process or disrupt our project calendar. Any source of unpredictability for our weekly or bi-monthly sprints is not exactly desirable.</p><p>The easiest solution as a dev shop is to discourage feedback from an audience outside of our team and our client\u2019s project team. That way, we deliver clean, tested code which meets every requirement defined during our discovery and planning phases. We fulfill the timeline and budget objectives, and can sleep easy knowing the client is satisfied. In the above case, the client and SB simply hope end users will be equally thrilled with how we executed the project. However, our best work is not produced in a vacuum. Rather, SB creates software using a combination of inputs: our insight as development and design experts; our client\u2019s recommendations as SMEs on their product, organization, and business goals; and end users\u2019 suggestions as experts in how they want to use mobile and web devices, and what they want to use them to accomplish.</p><p>At Smashing Boxes we circumvent any feedback related issues through communication and planning. We negotiate willfully for the flexibility to obtain feedback and implement changes as identified by various stakeholders. While introducing a feedback loop to a project seemingly adds time and cost, it\u2019s a necessary step for iterative development. As a result, the end product becomes a truer reflection of the goals our clients initially hired us to attain.</p><p><em>Cover image by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coofdy/\"><em>Martin Kenny</em></a><br></p>",

A common question that arises in any discussion about entrepreneurship in general, is \u201cwhat does it take to be an entrepreneur\u201d? I have answered this question many times over, as had my fellow panelists, and I realized there was a common thread, which I have named the Four P\u2019s of entrepreneurship.</p><h5><strong>Passion</strong></h5><p>You have to love what you are doing. It\u2019s not a decision based on metrics such as risk / reward. It\u2019s not a job. It\u2019s your life. You have to be so passionate about your startup or small business that it oozes out of you and makes people want to work with you and for you. Passion is what gives you the drive and motivation to see through the bumps in the road to the higher goal, helping you continue working toward that goal, even when it seems hopeless.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTobias Rose, of \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.komplekscreative.com\">Komplex Creative</a>, really dove deep into this P, noting that passion is also how you differentiate yourself, through your passion for the work you are producing. They are a company similar to ours, and it\u2019s great to hear that we share the same values.</p><h5><strong>Persistence</strong></h5><p>\u2013 As a startup, people will NOT be knocking down your door to hand you money for your product or service, or invest in your startup. <a href=\"http://www.shoeboxed.com\">Tobi Walters</a> at Shoeboxed discussed the fact that he had no fewer than 70 meetings pitching investors to raise financing. What if he stopped at 69? He, like all entrepreneurs, had a goal or a task, and \u201cno\u201d was not an option. In my situation, I get \u201cNO\u201d all of the time. We do not win every project that we pursue, and I cannot let that get me down, or get in the way of ultimate dream I am pursuing. Keep following up, keep showing up, keep fighting\u2026whether it\u2019s for a coffee meeting with a potential mentor, raising money, or winning business, it\u2019s hard, so be ready.</p><h5><strong>Perseverance</strong></h5><p>While persistence, in my opinion, has a more tactical and operational implication (don\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer), perseverance speaks to the emotional strength that is needed to be an entrepreneur. Think about having no money in the bank and two weeks until the next set of bills are due (be it payroll if you have staff, or personal bills like rent, car payment). You can persist through yeses and noes and not let it impact your being, but when you\u2019re faced with pending doom around every corner, that\u2019s a much deeper issue. As an entrepreneur, your \u201cbusiness\u201d issues \u2013 such as a customer going out of business and not paying an invoice, or an investor deciding to pass on your startup \u2014 are also personal issues \u2014 you are broke, you can\u2019t make payroll, you can\u2019t pay rent,  you\u2019re a failure. Weathering these storms takes a strong character, a vision for the future, and the passion and persistence to see it through regardless of the ups and downs.</p><h5><strong>Preparation</strong></h5><p>There are three ways to look at preparation: personal planning, business planning, and working hard. I don\u2019t focus much on business plans, because I think they\u2019re a waste of time. On the personal front, be prepared emotionally and financially. This will cost more than you think, and it will take longer than you think to make money. The typical rule of thumb is that \u201cit\u201d (your project, your startup, etc..) will take twice as long and cost 3 times as much. That is common knowledge among entrepreneurs, and was reaffirmed by my fellow panelist Jay Bigelow of <a href=\"http://www.cednc.org\">CEDNC</a>, who\u2019s been there and done that several times over. While it\u2019s oversimplified, do your best to not be cutting it so close that you can\u2019t adjust when that does inevitably arise. Working hard is the other form of preparation that is key to entrepreneurial success. You have passion, you persist, and you persevere. When you let nothing get in your way of success, and you continue to build, sell, improve, innovate, and press forward, you are preparing yourself for success. When you read a success story on <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a>, or hear about the person who was on the brink of bankruptcy only to land their biggest account and turn it all around, remember that they were working hard the entire time and this is the result that they were preparing themselves for.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn closing, I hope this message reaches all aspiring entrepreneurs. My goal is to give some baseline context for what it takes to be successful. Once you are comfortable with these four core principles, then it\u2019s time to get to work!</p><p><em>Cover photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marlenek/\"><em>Daniele Marlenek</em></a><br></p>",

Gone are the days of screenshotting Typekit font samples to snag headlines to place in a Photoshop document to see if all the type could work together. A month or so ago I stumbled across a crazy new web app that fills a need web designers have yearned for since the web type revolution, \r\n\t<a href=\"http://typecastapp.com/\">Typecast App.</a></p><p>\r\n\tI set my first real type on a \r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Vandercook+letterpress&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=-h9yT6zmIMXdtge3oIDiDw&amp;biw=1062&amp;bih=679&amp;sei=_B9yT4b1CMuztwe3z9i1Dw\">Vandercook letterpress</a>. I was able to pick out the small pieces of lead, place them reversed on a slab of metal, then roll some paper over inked type and make a print. That was pretty cool. Then I learned how to set type in InDesign \u2013 using proper grids, baselines, columns and such \u2013 and create a well-set book. I felt like I was rockin\u2019 it. With all this control in other mediums, the web was frustrating. I couldn\u2019t set anything easily without a sort of workaround. I had to find a typeface on another service, take screenshots, and put them all together, just to see how something paired. I was one of the lucky ones to get a [requested] invitation to dive into Typecast and get my hands dirty.  After a few minutes of using Typecast, I had that feeling again: \u201cTthis is pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tThe team at \r\n\t<a href=\"http://designbyfront.com/\">Front</a> saw a real need within the design community and has made something that fills it  wholeheartedly. One of the first, and easily best, features is the integration of all the major players in the webfont services field, i.e. <a href=\"http://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a>, <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Fontdeck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webfonts\">Google Webfonts</a>. This ability alone easily quartered the time I\u2019ve spent trying to find the right typeface pairings for a project. I was sold.</p><p>\r\n\tTypecast is one of the first \u201cnew tools\u201d I\u2019ve used. It brought me joy to design something on the web again. I believe it\u2019s the first in a slew that are about to be released that change how web designers work. \r\n\t<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aptus/id510487565?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">Aptus</a>, a web browser released by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/aexmo\">Alex Morris</a>, was released this week. It\u2019s designed to be a web browser that helps Responsive Web Design and development. <a href=\"http://www.gridsetapp.com/\">Gridset</a>, by <a href=\"http://markboultondesign.com/\">Mark Boulton Design</a>, is going to be another player in my upcoming arsenal.

After 7 years in school studying computer science, I didn\u2019t feel like doing \u201crocket science\u201d the rest of my life. Not all computer scientists (let\u2019s say developers from now on) enjoy dealing with the underlying complexities of computers every day. While studying, my area of interest was to solve complex problems with simple technology and Ruby fit like a glove.</p><p>\r\n\tThis blog post started 8 months ago with this \r\n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leonelgalan/status/310047686994849792\">tweet</a>.

My PHP skills are rusty so I asked myself, colleagues, and Google what is the easiest way of getting the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.time.php\">next week in PHP</a> (see the code examples below).</p><h5><strong>Ruby</strong></h5>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: ruby; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;p&gt;1.week.from_now\r\n#=&gt; Tue, 12 Nov 2013 11:40:37 EST -05:00&lt;/p&gt;\r\n</pre><h5><strong>PHP</strong></h5>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;?php\r\necho date('Y-m-d', strtotime('+1 week'));\r\n// 2 Warnings and ...\r\n// 2013-11-12\r\n?&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><h5><strong>Java</strong></h5>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">import java.util.Calendar;\r\nclass ThisIsAClassIDontReallyWantToNameButJavaMakesMe {\r\n  public static void main() {\r\n    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\r\n    calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 7);\r\n    System.out.printf(\"%tF%n\", calendar);\r\n    // 2013-11-12\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tHopefully these examples proved to you that Ruby code is the prettiest and results in the most readable text. This allows even non-developers to somewhat understand your code even without comments. Stay tuned for my next post in the series and let us know in the comments what you love (or don\u2019t love) about Ruby!</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company known for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

A decade or so ago only a very few professionals used the term Logistics, yet it very quickly moved from an IT and Operations handle into the boardroom.  Dr. Braunstein explains how data logistics impacts the health care system\u2026</em></p><h3>\r\n\tBig Data/Big Cloud\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tTo manage healthcare beyond the one doctor/one patient scenario, digital records are required. I noticed about three years ago that my primary care physician seemed to apologize a lot for not spending as much time \u201clooking me in the eye\u201d as he wanted to. Instead, he spent more time looking at his screen to be sure he was capturing the data appropriately. He was frustrated by it but knew it was important. Today\u2019s health care ecosystem requires that your data be shared among many entities: specialists, insurance companies, hospitals, rehab centers, etc.</p><p>\r\n\tBig Data certainly is impacting the current state of Healthcare IT (HIT).  While many definitions have arisen, at its essence big data is the term for the collection, storage and analysis of data sets so large and complex that processing the information requires advanced computing power and systems. This data is indeed being gathered, and it allows for new technologies to be developed that continually improve the industry. Indeed, it is spurring new entrepreneurial opportunities throughout all industries that touch the medical field \u2013 including government.</p><p>\r\n\tIt could well be that it is a combination of \u201cthe cloud\u201d and advent of big data analysis that has established the opportunity for the success of Healthcare IT. Dr. Braunstein suggested that, in IT, we make more of the Cloud than need be. Yet, it is the very fact that we can move data to the cloud and access it anywhere that opens up so many opportunities for healthcare IT.</p><p>\r\n\tCertainly the ability to access highly intimate and personal information on everyone in America has put some ill-at-ease. Data security becomes more critical than ever \u2013 and yet, we cannot possibly go back. There are <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/\">HIPAA regulations</a> to help address these concerns, but new and better security systems and applications are yet another opportunity for healthcare IT innovation.</p><h3>\r\n\tFinancing and the Affordable Care Act\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tIf there is one industry in our country that needs reformation, healthcare is it. Other industries invested heavily in, and benefitted from, the streamlining of operations when they began utilizing IT for a more efficient and effective workplace. With the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/\">Affordable Care Act</a> applying regular pressure to the systems behind the care, new technologies and strategies are being developed and deployed that ostensibly make it easier for consumers to control their own healthcare.</p><p>\r\n\tAccording to Braunstein, healthcare in America remains a trailing edge industry. We\u2019ve been bypassed by numerous nations throughout Europe, and many African countries have found ways to take better advantage of technology than we have\u2026 not only for tracking information and insurance, but for providing pharmaceutical data and apps that help with preventative care.</p><p>\r\n\tNot surprisingly, the reasons for this can be traced back to money. The reduction in healthcare spending, Dr. Braunstein points out, has fallen below inflation for the first time in U.S. history. In November, 2013, the White House published a paper entitled <em><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/healthcostreport_final_noembargo_v2.pdf\">Trends in Health Care Cost Growth and the Role of the Affordable Care Act</a> </em>in which it made these key points:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li><em>Health care spending growth is the lowest on record. According to the most recent projections, real per capita health care spending has grown at an estimated average annual rate of just 1.3 percent since 2010. This is the lowest rate on record for any three-year period and less than one-third the long-term historical average stretching back to 1965.</em></li>\t\r\n<li><em>The North American health IT market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4% to reach a total value of $31.3 billion in 2017, compared to $21.9 billion in 2012, the research firm Markets and Markets predicted in a new report.</em></li>\t\r\n<li><em>The value of the US market, which accounts for nearly three quarters of North American HIT revenue, will rise to $22.6 billion in 2017.</em></li></ul><p>\r\n\tWith both ample room for growth and the estimated $22.6 billion in growth in the next three years, opportunity appears to be extensive.</p><p>\r\n\tBe sure to read the <a title=\"The Impact of Healthcare IT Part 3: Entrepreneurial Vistas\" href=\"/ideas/the-impact-of-healthcare-it-part-3/\">Impact of Health Care IT Part 3</a>, we address opportunities for innovation, and where entrepreneurs are having the most impact.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rh2ox/\">R2Hox</a><br></p>",

Perhaps more important is that providing&nbsp;high quality graphics can make your app stand out from the competition.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are writing custom views, you are also responsible for providing the&nbsp;drawing code. iOS&nbsp;accommodates&nbsp;two popular ways of custom drawing for your application: OpenGL and native rendering which includes Quartz, Core Animation, and&nbsp;UIKit.</p><p>By using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/graphicsimaging/conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/Introduction/Introduction.html\">Quartz 2D</a> drawing API, you can implement custom views.  Quartz 2D is also known as Core Graphics (CG). When drawing custom views, CG offers a myriad of options. CG provides path based drawing, color management, off-screen rendering, and anti-aliased rendering. Additionally, it contains PDF options for PDF creation, PDF displaying and PDF parsing (reading the byte code in the PDF file stream).</p><p>One note of caution is to always remember to override&nbsp;the drawRect method when drawing in your custom view. Use the drawRect method to write your code to draw, but never call the drawRect method in your&nbsp;code. Instead, call the setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsDisplayInRect&nbsp;method to notify the system that your view requires redrawing. Then the system can queue your setNeedsDisplay calls and automatically sweep through. During the sweep the system scans the view hierarchy and redraws views based on those who called setNeedsDisplay.</p><p>At the most basic level CG allows you to draw paths, patterns, shadows and&nbsp;gradients into contexts. There are several different contexts: PDF, Bitmap, Printing, and Window Graphics. While the PDF context generates PDF documents, the&nbsp;Bitmap context generates jpg and png images. The printing context is for, you guessed it, drawing something to be printed. Finally, the Window Graphics context helps with tasks like free-hand drawing or building paths to create shapes for on-screen viewing.</p><p>By utilizing Core Graphics in your next application you can improve UX and increase display speed of custom views on your iOS device.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tThere\u2019s been a \r\n\t<a title=\"The Cloud Is Not for You\" href=\"http://justcramer.com/2012/06/02/the-cloud-is-not-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\">bit</a> of <a title=\"Heroku Isn't for Idiots\" href=\"http://rdegges.com/heroku-isnt-for-idiots\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> lately on deployment options. Much of the debate is centered around the relative merits of Heroku. We have some experience with Heroku and Amazon Web Services (AWS), so let\u2019s dive into some comparisions.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>\r\n\tThis is the only metric that counts for many clients, so it\u2019s good to start here. The trouble with price comparisons is that no two services are exactly the same, so it\u2019s hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison. So let\u2019s see what we can get at the entry level.</p><h3>Heroku</h3><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Free for the first <a title=\"Heroku dyno\" href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos\" target=\"_blank\">dyno</a>\r\n\t</li></ul><p>\r\n\tYou can\u2019t beat free, and this is actually quite a good offering. One dyno is plenty to run many kinds of apps. Brochure sites, simple APIs, and blogs are a few of the many possible uses for this free dyno. But to make the comparison fair, we need to know what this free dyno includes and what strings are attached.</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>RAM: 512MB</li>\t\r\n<li>Swap space: 1GB max</li>\t\r\n<li>Storage space: <a title=\"Max slug size\" href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler#slug_size\" target=\"_blank\">100MB</a> max</li>\t\r\n<li>Compute power: unknown, but feels like something between a micro and a small EC2 instance.</li></ul><h5>Drawbacks</h5><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Additional dynos/workers are $35 a month.</li>\t\r\n<li>No other services can be run on dynos. Dynos are strictly for application processes. Databases, background workers, and other services usually cost extra through Heroku\u2019s add-ons or third party services.</li>\t\r\n<li>No way to increase RAM, storage, or CPU performance. Additional storage must be hosted separately through a service such as Amazon S3. App performance can only be improved by increasing the number of running dynos. Heroku automatically <a title=\"HTTP Routing\" href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing\" target=\"_blank\">load balances and routes visitors to all available dynos</a>.</li>\t\r\n<li>No way to install system software. Heroku does provide some commonly-used packages such as Imagemagick, but if you need anything else, you\u2019ll have to resort to <a title=\"Hacking Heroku with Custom Buildpacks\" href=\"http://quickleft.com/blog/hacking-heroku-with-custom-build-packs\" target=\"_blank\">hacks</a>.</li></ul><h3>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3><p>\r\n\tAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is the closest equivalent to Heroku\u2019s dynos. One EC2 micro instance is approximately equivalent in terms of RAM and compute power to one of Heroku\u2019s dynos/workers. However, in our experience, the performance of a full-stack Rails application on a single micro EC2 instance is not quite as good as on a single Heroku dyno. This could be because we were running database and workers on the same instance. We could have probably slimmed down the instance by removing unnecessary system processes, but instead we typically go with a small EC2 instance.\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/EC2_micro_small.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-441\" title=\"EC2 Micro and Small\" alt=\"EC2 Micro and Small\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/EC2_micro_small.png\" width=\"658\" height=\"334\"></a><br>\r\nAs you can see, \r\n\t<a title=\"EC2 Pricing\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">EC2 is much cheaper when paid for in advance</a>. Let\u2019s just go with a one year heavy utilization reserved small instance for this comparison.</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>$27.77 a month on average (after amortizing the deposit and paying for the usage over one year).</li>\t\r\n<li>RAM: 1.7GB</li>\t\r\n<li>Swap space: configurable (presumably up to the total amount of storage space minus root partition)</li>\t\r\n<li>Storage space: 160GB</li>\t\r\n<li>Compute power: 1 EC2 Compute Unit</li></ul><p>\r\n\tAgain, it\u2019s hard to make a direct comparison, but some of these figures are considerably higher than Heroku\u2019s (1600 times the storage space!).</p><h5>Drawbacks</h5><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>You have to deploy your application yourself, either through Chef recipes, Capistrano, or manually.</li>\t\r\n<li>You have to administer the system yourself. EC2 has machine images of popular distros such as Ubuntu that are easily launched, but after that it\u2019s up to you to keep it up to date and secure.</li>\t\r\n<li>Scaling horizontally (i.e. launching multiple app instances) is not as easy as with Heroku where it\u2019s just a matter of moving a slider on their web interface. You\u2019d better get familiar with Chef if you want to scale up and down frequently. This seems like a big drawback but in practice we rarely adjust the number of running instances for an app.</li>\t\r\n<li>AWS is more expensive for the basic offering. There is a free tier that will give you one free micro instance for the first year (only available when you first sign up) but this is not as generous as Heroku\u2019s free, unlimited, single dyno apps.</li></ul><h3>Real life cost examples</h3><p>\r\n\tSay we have an app that needs 10MB database storage, one worker, and SSL. With Heroku this will break down to the following:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>$20 for increased database storage. Heroku\u2019s free shared database only offers 5MB storage. They are rolling out a new option but it\u2019s unclear what the specs are.</li>\t\r\n<li>$20 for the <a title=\"SSL Endpoint\" href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/ssl\" target=\"_blank\">SSL endpoint</a>\r\n\t</li>\t\r\n<li>$35 for the worker process</li>\t\r\n<li>\r\n\t<strong>Total:</strong> $75 per month</li></ul><p>\r\n\tTo get the same thing on Amazon you\u2019d pay the following:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>$57.60 for an on-demand small EC2 instance (or $27.77 for a one year commitment; $17.69 for three years).</li></ul><p>\r\n\tAdmittedly it\u2019s not a huge savings for the first month, but let\u2019s say you need to add Redis and MongoDB. They both live mainly in memory, so it\u2019s a good thing we went with the 1.7GB RAM on Amazon. We can easily run both of these services on our single small instance. On Heroku we\u2019d need to add the following:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Redis To Go Small 100MB Instance &mdash; $25</li>\t\r\n<li>MongoLab Small 0.50GB Storage &mdash; $10</li></ul><p>\r\n\tWith Amazon it\u2019s easy from a price perspective to add or remove services. If you go with Heroku, you may have to ask your client for an additional monthly payment for each service you add, making the decision more difficult and time consuming.</p><h3>Other considerations</h3><p>\r\n\tBesides costs, you will want to consider whether or not it\u2019s even possible to run your application on Heroku before going that route. If you need to run custom binaries or compile from source, you will have to figure out how to hack Heroku, or you may be out of luck. If you need to store temporary files you should know that \r\n\t<a title=\"Ephemeral File System\" href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-isolation#ephemeral_filesystem\" target=\"_blank\">Heroku\u2019s ephemeral file system</a> does not make that task easy. You could end up exerting a lot of effort only to eventually run into a brick wall. Personally, I\u2019ve had to <a title=\"Github issue\" href=\"https://github.com/customink/central_logger/pull/11\" target=\"_blank\">hack gems</a> and <a title=\"Ruby debug on Heroku\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6430419/run-ruby-debug-on-heroku\" target=\"_blank\">try</a> to find <a title=\"SO question\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6417475/rails-how-can-i-use-system-zip-on-heroku-to-make-a-docx-from-an-xml-template\" target=\"_blank\">workarounds</a> for many Heroku-specific issues.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if you know your application will fit within the limitations, deployment on Heroku is a breeze. The web interface is beautiful, the CLI client works well for the most part (except it can\u2019t manage multiple Heroku accounts), and it\u2019s easy to add other services through add-ons. But if you think your app\u2019s needs might grow in ways that won\u2019t be satisfied by simple horizontal scaling, you should definitely consider AWS. Of course, you can always start with Heroku and later migrate to AWS, but in that case you will have to configure your app for two environments and spend the time to migrate everything.</p><h3>Other options?</h3><p>\r\n\tIn my experience, there are simply no other platforms that compare well with Heroku or AWS. There are some nice Heroku alternatives such as Dotcloud, but they suffer from coming after Heroku and thus having less integration with third-party products and less community support. Rackspace is the closest competitor to AWS, but it lacks the rich APIs and support that Amazon provides. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see competitors catching up to Heroku and AWS and offering us more choices.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>\r\n\tBoth Heroku and AWS are excellent platforms. They are quite different in some key areas. Understanding what each offers is essential to picking the right platform for your application. There is no clear winner here. Personally I like to use both. But my (simplified) mental test for which one to use is this: small app\u2013Heroku; large app\u2013Amazon.

Luckily for app developers, most mHealth applications will bypass the approval process, but these regulations should be kept in mind when developing mHealth apps in the future.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>What type of apps will the FDA regulate?</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tThe FDA plans to concentrate its regulations on mHealth apps that have the potential to be health risks to consumers and classify these as \u201cmobile medical apps\u201d (MMAs) in their guidance document. The applications that will be controlled are those that are classified as devices in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and are designed to: 1) convert mobile devices into medical devices that fall under FDA regulations or 2) be used as additional components to medical devices which fall under FDA regulations. The FDA states that only apps and devices that may risk a patient\u2019s safety when nonfunctional are considered MMAs.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>What are some examples of apps that will be regulated?</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tApps that use built-in features of phones or make use of additional sensors/attachments to perform medical tasks that are typically performed by health care practitioners to treat and diagnose diseases will be regulated. These include apps that measure heart activity, amplify heart sounds, and measure blood glucose levels. Additionally, apps that are used to control implantable or worn medical devices such as to change the setting of infusion pumps, act as wireless remote controls for imaging machines, and to calibrate cochlear implants fall under the regulations. Visit the guidance document linked above for a more complete list of examples.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>What if my app is already on the market?</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tSince most existing health apps do not fall under the FDA\u2019s regulation guidelines, it is likely that if your app is already in app stores, you do not have to do anything and your app can remain on the market without extra review. The FDA has already approved approximately 100 mobile medical apps, which include ~40 apps in the past 2 years (\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ConnectedHealth/MobileMedicalApplications/ucm368784.htm\">examples of approved MMAs</a>). Therefore, even before final guidance was released, it is likely you knew that your app may be considered a <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/\">Class II</a> medical device and you submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>What do I need to submit before marketing my app?</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tLuckily, not all mobile medical apps must obtain \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/default.htm\">Premarket Approval</a> (PMA) or submit a <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/default.htm\">510(k) Premarket Notification</a> and submit their associated fees (<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm048161.htm\">PMA fees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/ucm134566.htm\">510(k) fees</a>) before they can be marketed. The degree of regulation and approval depends on the classification of your app. Most Class I devices are exempt and just have to comply with \u201c<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/GeneralandSpecialControls/ucm055910.htm\">General Controls</a>.\u201d To determine the FDA classification for<br>\r\nyour app, the FDA suggests that you search the \u201c\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm\">Product Classification</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm\">510(k) Premarket Notification</a>\u201d databases to find comparable apps and observe their associated regulations.</p><p>\r\n\tThe FDA wants to facilitate innovation and hopes that mHealth apps will enable better care and patient empowerment, but this guidance was necessary to ensure that the apps are safe. If you have any questions related to mobile medical apps, \r\n\t<a href=\"mailto:mobilemedicalapps@fda.hhs.gov\">send an email to the FDA</a>. If you have any questions or opinions to share with us about the MMA guidance, leave a comment below.</p><p>\r\n\tWe hope that the guidelines promote the development of more mHealth apps, startups, and investments.

So for a couple of active projects, our developers decided to exclusively use GitHub issues to track to-do items. We would gather our tasks based on a requirements document in Google Drive and add them as issues within GitHub. We would assign ourselves to the issue if it was something we were currently working on or something we could do quicker than anyone else. And when we pushed a commit, we could close the issue from the commit message. GitHub has a <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">nice writeup</a> on what all you can do with their issue management.</p><p>After using the issues to manage tasks on those guinea pig projects, we made a few discoveries. For starters, we worked more efficiently in handling basic task management. Before using GitHub Issues, we would gather requirements from a Google document, Basecamp Project, and / or a Pivotal Tracker project. Once we completed the task and deployed to a staging environment for review, we would have to navigate to that task in the project management system of the week&trade; and check it off. We gained time when not having to deal with other systems.</p><p>Another great feature is collaboration. We were able to comment on issues and get feedback for the tasks we were working on. We could even comment on commits down to a specific line of code. We would then be notified within GitHub (and email) about collaboration happening on different issues.</p><p>The last great discovery came with getting the designers on board. They may not use it to the extent that the developers do, but they know enough now that when they come across a bug on the site, they can add an issue. Designers were happy. Developers were happy. Projects started progressing much smoother.</p><p>Going forward, our team will continue to use GitHub issues. We have labels for tasks \u201cOn Hold\u201d and \u201cNeeding Feedback\u201d so that he can quickly organize and manage each project. GitHub issues scratches our immediate project management itches, and we will continue to rock this way in the foreseeable future.</p><p><em>Check out our open source projects on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://github.com/smashingboxes\">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Cover photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/toolmantim/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Tim Lucas</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tSoftware architects in object&nbsp;oriented languages are asked to think about concepts and how these concepts or objects relate to each other. With SQL databases and more specifically ActiveRecord, you might sometimes have trouble with how to express this relation, especially when the related object has no meaning on its own.&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\tAs an example, let's think of a User which has an Address. This address is itself composed of a postal_code, state, country, etc. Let's look at four alternative solutions:</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Delegate</strong></p>\r\n<pre>has_one :address\r\n\r\ndelegate :postal_code, :state, :country, :city, :address_line1, to: :address\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tJust like other attributes of the User model such as name, the<em> address really has no value on its own</em>. It doesn't really make sense to have a Name model, neither does it make sense to have an Address model.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Large db&nbsp;table</strong></p><p>\r\n\tOne simple idea would be to have every address attribute be a column on the user table: address_zip, address_country, address_city...&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\tThis is really not optimal. In the case where some of these fields are optional, <em>we'd have lots of nil values in our database</em>.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Serialize</strong></p><p>\r\n\tIn the world of MongoDB and other noSQL databases there is the concept of embedded data (for example Mongoid's <a href=\"http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/v3/relations.html#embeds_one\">embed_one</a> function). The developer can chose which data they'd like to reference and which they'd like to have embedded.&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\tRails comes with a nifty&nbsp;<a href=\"http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/AttributeMethods/Serialization/ClassMethods/serialize\">serialize</a> method that is meant to do just this. To use it all we need is an address&nbsp;<strong>text</strong> column in the database (Alternatively we can also use Postgres' Hstore if we'd like to search the embedded fields).&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\tLet's give this a try:</p>\r\n<pre>serialize :address, Hash\r\n\r\nvalidates :postal_code, presence: true\r\n\r\ndef postal_code\r\n  address[:postal_code]\r\nend\r\ndef postal_code=(value)\r\n  address[:postal_code] = value\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tThat's great but if we are to write every field like this, <em>our models will be very crowded</em>.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Metaprogrammed Serialize</strong></p><p>\r\n\tWhat we'd really want is to write something like:</p>\r\n<pre>attr_embedded :address, [:postal_code, :state, :country, :city, :address_line1]\r\nattr_embedded :social_urls, [:facebook_url, :linkedin_url, :twitter_url]\r\n\r\nvalidates :postal_code, presence: true\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tWith a little bit of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/\">metaprogramming</a> magic we can get there. You can use the file below in your lib folder and you are done.</p>\r\n<pre>module EmbeddedAttrAccessible\r\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\r\n  module ClassMethods\r\n    def attr_embedded(real_attr, virtual_attrs)\r\n      serialize real_attr, Hash\r\n      virtual_attrs.each do |field|\r\n        define_method field do\r\n          read_attribute(real_attr)[field]\r\n        end\r\n        define_method \"#{field}=\" do |value|\r\n          read_attribute(real_attr)[field] = value\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nActiveRecord::Base.send :include, EmbeddedAttrAccessible\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tNow we can use our embedded fields just as we would any other field in our model.

How do you determine if a\r\ncode school program is right for you? In a word, tinker.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/LzCNYKqMDNN3q/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 600px;\"></p><p>\r\n\tTinkering is the act of playing around, teaching\r\nyourself, figuring out on your own how to solve a problem, \u2018Googling\u2019 it. It\u2019s\r\none of the most important attributes employers are looking for when they hire\r\nprogrammers. To help begin your tinkering adventure, we\u2019ve collected some\r\ngems from the plethora of (mostly free) coding tutorials available online.\r\nThese resources, and language descriptions, are specific to the technologies\r\nthat will be taught in our<a href=\"http://academy.smashingboxes.com/\">&nbsp;Academy</a> courses and\r\nmay not apply to all code schools. Leave us a comment at the end of this\r\narticle if you find anything noteworthy along the way.</p><h5>\r\n\t<em><strong>HTML/CSS</strong></em>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tHTML\r\n&amp; CSS are used to define the elements (headers, paragraphs, etc.) and\r\npresentation of a website. These are front end languages and\r\ncomponents. Front end engineering is the creation of an interface that\r\nallows the user and back end to communicate, it is essentially the appearance\r\nand interactivity of a website. Try \r\n\t<a href=\"https://dash.generalassemb.ly/\">Dash</a>,\r\na slide-based text and interactive tutorials (i.e. entering code in a window or\r\nscreen). Dash lets you tinker with several small projects: a personal website,\r\na responsible blog theme, a small business website, and a CSS robot. Dash\r\nincorporates JavaScript as well as HTML &amp; CSS.</p><h5>\r\n\t<em><strong>JavaScript&nbsp;</strong></em>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tJavaScript,\r\nanother front end language, is used to make pages more interactive. It is used\r\nwith other languages such as HTML to make the visual components more dynamic.\r\nTry \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript\">Codecademy</a> and\r\nuse interactive tutorials to create interactive websites and browser based\r\ngames.</p><h5>\r\n\t<strong><em>Ruby on Rails</em></strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\nRuby is modular, object-oriented programming language. Rails is a full-stack\r\nopen source web application framework. This means that it allows pages and\r\napplications to pull information from the server and talk directly to the\r\ndatabase.This back end language is open source and scalable, so it is able to\r\nbe used on projects of varying sizes. Also, websites and applications built\r\nusing Rails can be deployed quickly. Try \r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby\">Code\r\nSchool\r\n\t</a>\u2018s videos and interactive Ruby tutorials with challenges to\r\nlearn to build dynamic web applications.</p><h5>\r\n\t<em><strong>iOS</strong></em>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tObjective-C is the programming language of the iOS operating system of Apple products.\r\nTry \r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ios\">Code School</a>\u2018s videos and interactive iOS tutorials starting\r\nwith basic iOS development in Objective-C.</p><p>\r\n\tNow, perhaps you\u2019re thinking, \u201cIf you just gave me all of\r\nthese free coding tutorial websites, why should I enroll in a code school?\u201d We\r\nhope you\u2019ll check out these online sites to give you an understanding of what\r\nyou could be learning in depth at The Academy. Online code education is a great\r\nstart! However, like learning a foreign language, you need to completely\r\nimmerse yourself to become fluent. It is very difficult to fully understand\r\ndevelopment\u2019s complex subject matter and nuances from a website tutorial or\r\nYouTube video. In real world programming there can be multiple \u2018acceptable\u2019\r\nmethods to execute a command. Learning how to navigate the subjectivity of\r\nsoftware engineering is a benefit that The Academy provides in a classroom\r\nsetting: unscripted, open ended assignments that set you up to make judgments\r\nwithin the subjectivity of the field. The&nbsp;\r\n\t<a href=\"http://academy.smashingboxes.com/curriculum\">curriculum</a>\r\n\tprovides a fundamental understanding of complex steps and explains why things\r\nwork the way they do, giving you the tools and experience needed to succeed\r\nafter classes end. A code school experience will also provide the guidance\r\nof experts and the added benefit of having access to real-time culture and\r\ncollaboration in an entrepreneurial and technical environment\r\n\t<strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">.</strong></p><h3>\r\n\t<strong>CHOOSE WISELY</strong>\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/O7rTdX44j7HGM/giphy.gif\" style=\"width: 624px; display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"\"></p><p>\r\n\t<strong></strong>When it comes to code schools, there are\r\nseveral variations. In terms of curriculum, some programs focus intensely on\r\nlearning a specific language or highly related set of languages while other\r\nprograms provide a general, less focused, overview of many technologies.\r\nNeither is wrong or right, it simply depends on your goal. If you are hoping to\r\nleave the class with a job as a professional programmer, than you should look\r\ninto the first option. Alternatively, courses touching on numerous languages\r\nprovide an excellent technical foundation for people in non-programming roles\r\nin a technical environment, such as sales, marketing, technical writing, or\r\noperations.</p><p>\r\n\tThere is perhaps greater disparity in\r\ngraduate satisfaction between \r\n\t<a href=\"http://blog.theironyard.com/post/92054222278/no-night-classes\">part-time and full-time programs</a>.\r\nPart time programs allow for students to continue their everyday life while\r\ngetting a code school education. Students divide their time between their\r\nweekday job and code school, which is on evenings and/or weekends. This type of\r\nstudy allows for flexibility, but not for complete and undivided immersion into\r\nthe subject matter. Students of part time programs should be realistic about\r\nwhether this type of program will set them up for success as a professional\r\nprogrammer.</p><p>\r\n\tFull time programs, on the other hand, mean\r\nthat the program essentially becomes a student\u2019s day job, and then some. These\r\nprograms allow for the curriculum to be intensive and fully immersive because\r\nstudents won\u2019t have outside distractions or side projects demanding their\r\nconcentration and time in addition to schoolwork. Students of full-time\r\nprograms tend to have a much more positive experience \u2013 both in securing a job\r\nand possessing the abilities to do the job \u2013 post code school.</p><p>\r\n\tBefore making the (often life changing)\r\ndecision to attend a code school, ask yourself the following questions to help\r\ndetermine the right program for you:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>What are your career goals?</li>\t\r\n<li>Which style of learning best suits your needs?</li>\t\r\n<li>What serves the best purpose for your future?</li></ul><h3>\r\n\t<strong>GET NOTICED</strong>\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\t<strong></strong>Effective code schools offer guest\r\nlectures, \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">vetted instructors</a>, networking events,\r\nfreelance work, office tours, free tutoring, and other opportunities that help\r\nyou get face time with employers and local stakeholders.

He came across \r\n\t<a href=\"http://railsgirls.com/\">Rails Girls</a>. Rails Girls originally started in Helsinki, Finland but is now a global non-profit volunteer community encouraging women to enter the development world. They accomplish this by enabling volunteers from around the world to setup an event and teach women to program using Ruby on Rails.<a href=\"http://railsgirls.com/\"><img class=\" wp-image-4019 alignright\" alt=\"rails_girls\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rails_girls.png\" width=\"210\" height=\"172\"></a></p><p>As a Ruby enthusiast, Leonel saw this as the perfect opportunity for him to give back to the community. He was surprised that Charlotte, NC had beaten the Triangle in orchestrating a Rails Girls event, and reached out to Smashing Boxes\u2019 CEO,&nbsp;<a href=\"/bio/nick-jordan\">Nick Jordan</a>, to ask him to sponsor the event and secure venue space in the American Underground classroom. Once that groundwork was laid, Leonel raised awareness about the event, reaching out to two local meetup groups: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-RDU/\">Girl Develop It RDU</a> (that promotes women in technology) and the Triangle Ruby Brigade (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/\">Triangle.rb</a>). Additionally, he contacted the Computer Science departments at NC State University and UNC-Chapel Hill, utilizing their Facebook and Twitter channels.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Untitled.jpg\" style=\"text-align: center; background-color: initial;\"><img class=\" wp-image-4023 \" alt=\"Untitled\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Untitled.jpg\" width=\"207\" height=\"206\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Leonel Galan</p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"></p><p>\r\n\tThe Rails Girls Raleigh-Durham event ran from September 27\r\n\t<sup>th</sup> \u2013 28<sup>th</sup>. Demonstrating the need for the event, there were 81 applications accepted, and 23 individuals chosen for the two-day Ruby on Rails crash course. Eight volunteers came forward to offer their time in teaching, achieving the Rails Girls\u2019 desired teaching ratio of 3:1.</p><p>\r\n\tThe Rails Girls group was comprised of both local university students and adults; priority was given to those who had little or no development experience. On Friday night, the Installation Party set up the development environment on the women\u2019s personal laptops and showed inspirational videos. All day Saturday, there were coding sessions with intermittent five-minute \u201cLightning Talks\u201d with stories by development professionals &nbsp;discussing why they enjoyed the world of development. The 23 women created their own Twitter-like application using Ruby on Rails, quickly consuming the information and finishing their projects by lunchtime. The enthusiasts began adding extra functionalities to their applications in which the coaches were happy to cure their curiosity.</p><p>\r\n\tThe event received such positive feedback that Leonel intends to plan similar events in the future for the Triangle community, with varying levels of Ruby on Rails training. Through the process of planning for Rails Girls, he has realized the significant network of other talented developers in the area who were steadfastly willing to volunteer their time to educate others. He looks forward to engaging with these individuals as he plans future community developer learning events. \r\n\t<strong></strong></p><p>\r\n\tAt Smashing Boxes, we believe it is important to foster education and learning. Therefore, we wanted to share the most common development languages while encouraging women to be exposed to coding, a skill that allows women to springboard their careers. We are excited to see a member of our team taking an active role in this space.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

But ours is unique in that not only will you learn from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy\">world-class instructors</a>, but you\u2019ll have support from an entire company dedicated to growing talented developers. The school represents an equal partnership between&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theironyard.com\">The Iron Yard</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smashing Boxes</a>, marrying credibility and experience with a strong understanding of the local technology landscape. Our location in the entrepreneurial and tech-friendly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.americantobaccohistoricdistrict.com/\">American Tobacco Campus</a>, just minutes from  Research Triangle Park, is optimal for embracing technology and securing an enviable job in tech. You\u2019ll be smack-dab in the middle of one of the hottest tech campuses and start-up cities in the country.</p><p><strong>How much does the Academy cost?</strong></p><p>Dollar for dollar, we offer&nbsp;one of the most affordable coding programs in the United States&nbsp;for the quality and return on investment. Best-in-class instruction and true career support are hard to find (our job placement success rate is 100%, by the way). Additionally, the cost of living in Raleigh/Durham is generally far less than places like New York and San Francisco, making the life transition much more feasible for people in all walks of life. </p><p>Tuition for the cohort beginning January 12, 2015&nbsp;is $12,000. And there's never been a better time to apply as tuition is rising to $12,000 starting with our January 2015 cohort as we introduce several new programs to make our student experience even stronger. We do have financing options and scholarships available, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail below. </p><p>You\u2019ll also need to purchase a Macbook computer. We\u2019ll give more details below on the specifications required as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you offer financing?</strong></p><p>Yes, after all our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to launch a successful programming career. Explore our financing options below and note that each option requires a $1000 deposit to reserve your space in the class. </p><ul> <li>We are excited to offer financing through a partnership with <a href=\"https://climbcredit.co/\">Climb Credit</a>. Their plan offers 100% financing over a 3-year period. Once accepted to our program, you can apply for approval. Most applications find out if they qualify in the same day. </li><li>We also partner with Upstart, who can help you finance your experience at the Academy. Once you've applied to our program, ask our Campus Director, Jessica Mitsch, about this option during the interview process.</li></ul><p><strong>What scholarships are available and how can I apply? </strong></p><p><em>The&nbsp;Diversity Scholarship&nbsp;</em></p><p>The Diversity Scholarship&nbsp;provides support to women, people of color, military personnel, and people with disabilities.&nbsp;Each scholarship recipient receives a $1000 discount on the total cost of tuition and there is no cap on the number of students per class who can receive support.&nbsp;The application process is simple: we want to know how you'll support diversity by by making technology more open and available to underrepresented groups. (Applicants must be women&mdash;cis or trans, people of color, military personnel or people with disabilities). Apply for the diversity scholarship&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theironyard.typeform.com/to/VtoUdR\">here</a>.</p><p><em>The Smashing Boxes Design Scholarship</em></p><p>Being that we're&nbsp;both a design and development shop, we're always on the lookout for great designers who can code. Anyone with a professional design background who is enrolled in the Front End Engineering course is&nbsp;eligible&nbsp;to apply for the $1500 scholarship. To apply, email your portfolio and resume to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:academy@smashingboxes.com\">academy@smashingboxes.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How will I gain practical experience during the program?</strong></p><p>We teach far more than code, bringing in guest-lecturers who talk about design fundamentals, how to work well with designers, other disciplines of programming, entrepreneurship, product development, and more. We provide our students with the widest possible gamut of exposure so that they have a well-rounded view of the industry when they graduate. </p><p>Our guest lectures from this past cohort included talks from CEOs, CTOs, Developers, Designers, and Product Managers at companies such as:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.healthbytesnyc.com/\">Healthy Bytes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shoeboxed.com/\">Shoeboxed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fugitivelabs.com/\">Fugitive Labs</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.windsorcircle.com/\">Windsor Circle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thestartupfactory.co/\">The Startup Factory</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://validic.com/\">Validic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.spoonflower.com/welcome\">Spoonflower</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">Mozilla</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bronto.com/\">Bronto</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uservoice.com/\">UserVoice</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cognitect.com/\">Cognitect</a>, and of course Smashing Boxes and instructors from other Iron Yard locations. </p><p>In addition to guest lectures, students work on real projects. Whether it\u2019s an internal tool for The Iron Yard or Smashing Boxes, or an actual product we\u2019re building, our students have the chance to work on real stuff that actual customers will use.</p><p><strong>How will you support me to get a career as a programmer?</strong></p><p>Our career support is personalized. Our team works incredibly hard to get students where they want to be, whether that\u2019s a start up or a large corporation. We have contacts all around the country and after the program we meet weekly and communicate as often as needed with each student to execute a job-searching strategy. We also perform mock interviews so that there aren't any surprises when you graduate. </p><p>The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes especially shines in this area due to the nature of The Iron Yard - Smashing Boxes partnership along with our strong Employer Advisory Board. The Board is comprised of companies from various industries across the Triangle region who are interested in hiring Academy students. Additionally, board members provide insight into in-demand skills and emerging technologies and dedicate their time and expertise through guest lecturing and career advising.

Students in our current cohort have already started receiving&nbsp;job offers&nbsp;prior to graduation. Want to talk to our graduates? <a href=\"mailto:jessica@theironyard.com\">Email us</a>.</p><p><strong>Didn\u2019t you have an actual job guarantee at one point?</strong></p><p>Yes, we did. And we still would have the actual guarantee were we not seeking to become fully licensed post-secondary educational institutions in every state where we operate. What?? Yeah, seems crazy, doesn't it? You can read the full details <a href=\"http://blog.theironyard.com/post/92054220258/job-placement-program\">in this blog post</a>, but the short story is that in almost all cases state licensing organizations have a rule against using the word \"guarantee\" in messaging, or even implying that placement in a job is promised. That has been a core promise of ours since the beginning because we believe so much in our ability to get people ready for junior level web development roles. We have a proven track record&mdash;we've never had to issue a refund to a student.</p><p>Now to comply with licensing requirements we will be phasing out the language around the job placement \"guarantee\". For new locations launched from today, the job placement guarantee will no longer be part of the offer. Make no mistake: kick-ass career support and job placement will still be our goal, but we can no longer&mdash;by law&mdash;offer a guarantee or promised outcomes.</p><p>We've decided to go above and beyond simply job placement. As we said above, we're working to make our student experience the absolute best in the market, taking you beyond just your first job. </p><p><strong>How do you make all of this happen in only 12&nbsp;weeks?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, we accomplish this through hiring <a href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy\">the most talented people out there</a>. Our employees are some of the most highly-paid people in their industry because they\u2019re extremely accomplished and talented people. But their not just great developers, the people we hire are passionate about changing people\u2019s lives through code education and they invest their heart and soul into making that happen. (Several have left huge companies and promising startups to join our team because they believe in our mission).</p><p>More practically, our program works really well because of our approach to education. We are committed to training the highest quality developers in the world, both in skill and in character. That involves training students to think like engineers and solve problems&mdash;not just how to type the syntax of a language. Knowing syntax and punctuation doesn\u2019t make you a great writer; in the same way simply knowing how to write some JavaScript doesn\u2019t make you a great programmer&mdash;that\u2019s the easy part. Because of this focus on training our students to think like experienced developers, our graduates have an amazing level of aptitude after only 12 weeks with us.</p><p><strong>How much experience do I need to enroll in the academy?</strong></p><p>Technically none, but you\u2019ll have a much easier time if you have some <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/three-ways-to-make-code-school-work-for-you\">prior experience</a>. Here is the breakdown of prior coding experience from a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/durhams-first-code-academy-by-the-numbers\">survey of our first cohort</a>:</p><ul><li>No prior programming experience - 21%</li><li>Minimal experience (e.g. online tutorials) - 32%</li><li>Moderate experience (e.g. took a coding class in school) - 42%</li><li>Extensive (e.g. Bachelor\u2019s degree in CS) - 5%</li></ul><p>If you\u2019re reading this now and want to apply for the upcoming cohort but have no coding experience, don\u2019t fret. Start working through some online tutorials and reach out to us so we can make recommendations on where to start depending on the course you want to take. </p><p><strong>How much time and commitment will it really take?</strong></p><p>We are very clear with our students about how difficult this program is. We train professional programmers, not casual enthusiasts. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/durhams-first-code-academy-by-the-numbers\">survey of our first cohort</a> showed that&nbsp;students spent an average of 80 hours per week on Academy-related work. Many students say the Academy was the most challenging, and equally the most rewarding experience, of their careers. </p><p><strong>What makes it so demanding?</strong> </p><p>You learn a new subject almost every day and have homework associated with that topic due at 8:00am the next day (or Monday if it\u2019s a weekend). The assignments are cumulative, so you incorporate things you\u2019ve already learned into new ones so that by the end you have muscle memory across the spectrum of the subjects you\u2019re studying.</p><p>Don\u2019t get us wrong&mdash;we\u2019re not workaholics and we don\u2019t want you to be either, but building the foundation for a great, balanced career is no easy task. Our policy is \u201cwork hard during class so you don\u2019t have to afterwards.\u201d</p><p><strong>What have students said about The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes?</strong></p><p>These quotes come from a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/durhams-first-code-academy-by-the-numbers\">recent survey of the first Durham cohort</a>. </p><p><em>\u201cThis program is fantastic...largely due to the exemplary instructors and campus director, and the focus on job placement. My only regret is that this program wasn't available years ago!\u201d</em></p><p><em>\u201cIt was the best decision I have made in my career.\u201d</em></p><p><em>\u201cIt can be difficult for absolute beginners. I would recommend lots of online tutorials/research before enrolling.\u201d</em></p><p><em>\u201cAs a mid-career professional, I had some reservations about taking the risk. It was well worth leaving my full-time position, and I am incredibly encouraged about my future as a developer. The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes promised to provide an adventure and change my life -- they delivered on both. I will be forever grateful.\u201d</em></p><p><em>\u201cLife changing.\u201d</em></p><p>\u201cThe collaboration and support were really what made the difference for me. The improvement in my confidence is even more helpful than the improvement in my skills.\u201d</p><p><strong>What kind of computer do I need?</strong></p><p>We require all students to use a Mac laptop (specs below). Why, you ask? There are a few reasons:</p><p>First, all students being on the same platform enables our classes to move much more quickly. Our instructors only have to explain certain things (like setting up new tools) once because workflows apply to everyone. If we allowed students to use different computers with different operating systems, classes simply wouldn't cover as much ground.</p><p>Second, for almost all developers using open-sourced technology, Macs are the tool of choice. Working in a UNIX environment is a huge asset. The open source and web development communities are invested in tools and libraries that work with Apple's OS. In short, using a Mac best prepares our students to work in the development industry.</p><p>Here are the minimum specifications required:</p><ul> <li>Manufacturer: Apple</li><li>Type: Laptop</li><li>Operating system: OS X Mavericks</li><li>RAM: At least 4 GB</li><li>Processor: At least 1.4 Ghz</li><li>HD space: At least 128 GB</li></ul><p>Mavericks is a free upgrade from Apple, so even if your operating system is older you can get the latest and greatest without having to spend any money. Not sure if your machine is compatible? Below is a list of Mac laptops that can run Mavericks. You can also read all of the details about Mavericks compatibility on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/osx/specs/\">Apple's website</a>.</p><ul> <li>MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)</li><li>MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)</li><li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)</li></ul><p><strong>Do you offer housing?</strong></p><p><a href=\"mailto:jessica@theironyard.com\">Email us</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Learn more about The Iron Yard Academy powered by Smashing Boxes at the Academy's website:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://academy.smashingboxes.com\">academy.smashingboxes.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tInnovation begins with an idea. A spark of intuition based on an assumption - that there is a problem or that something could be better, and that we can solve it. But an idea, even a great one, isn\u2019t enough to create a product that is both usable and desired. To reach that sweet spot and create a better, more useful product, we need to begin with discovery.</p><h3>Discovery? But I already know everything.</h3><p>\r\n\tLet\u2019s just settle this right now. Discovery is not iterating on the features of your product. The purpose of discovery is to dig into your users\u2019 desires and needs, challenge your assumptions, and then reject your \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions.</p><p><em>\r\n\tTip # 1: Do not let your ego hold you back from innovating.</em></p><p>\r\n\tEntrepreneurs and product owners are enthusiastic! As they should be - they have a great idea and they\u2019re ready to build an awesome product. This is needed because it\u2019s what drives us to move on our ideas and to create something out of nothing. But there\u2019s a downside to this passion - product owners often approach the development process thinking they fully understand the problem, user, or vision, and are unwilling to challenge their assumptions. Their ego is holding them back from innovating.</p><p>\r\n\tAssumption challenging requires confidence and humility - we must be able to acknowledge that we may not have all the answers, or the right ones.</p><h3>Create the opportunity for success.</h3><p>\r\n\tWhile there is no blanket solution for discovery, the most direct route to building the right product is to identify what people really want and would actually use. This is done by putting yourself in a position to make observations that lead to moments of clarity, the value of which cannot be understated.</p><p>\r\n\tThere are many ways to approach observation, and they don\u2019t have to be expensive or time consuming. A great way to start is to have a person who fits your user profile play around with a competitor\u2019s product, or on your existing product if you\u2019re doing a redesign.</p><p><em>\r\n\tTip # 2: Don\u2019t expect people to tell you exactly what they need or desire.</em></p><p>\r\n\tIt\u2019s your job to read between the lines. Observe your users and listen to them. Where are they hitting road blocks? What are they excited by? What problem is this product solving for them? These observations are the first step in determining what gaps exist and the best way to move forward with a design. Ultimately, this is what leads to groundbreaking discoveries. This process of observation is so simple it\u2019s almost unnerving, but it is the perfect recipe for doing something that has never been done before.</p><h3>Work smarter and not harder.</h3><p>\r\n\tThere are numerous misconceptions about discovery and experience design in general. Some being that discovery is too expensive, a nice to have, or just isn\u2019t practical for a first release. We\u2019re going to crush this right now.</p><p>\r\n\tFirst off, discovery does not have to break the bank. Cue discount usability (coined by \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.affinitylab.com/news/usability-testing-made-easy/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Kreg</a>) in which you test a limited number of people (usually three) to quickly get initial feedback. Three users! This is all you need to observe behavior and begin to challenge your assumptions.</p><p><em>\r\n\tTip # 3: Start testing early and often.</em></p><p>\r\n\tDumb it down. You do need something to test but there is no need to have a final design. All you need to start getting valuable feedback are low fidelity designs and text. A great example of this is \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/Web-Prototyping-tutorials/UX-Design-Techniques-Paper-Prototyping/161093-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">paper prototyping</a>, where you essentially have users navigate a website or digital tool by \u201cclicking\u201d on paper. Evaluate where they \u201cclick\u201d, how they navigate the interface, and even gauge their facial expressions when using the tool. How do they navigate through it? Is it frustrating to figure out what to do next? Keep your questions open ended and ask the user what problem it is solving for them.</p><h3>Don\u2019t gamble on your product.</h3><p>\r\n\tSure, there is a chance that all of your initial assumptions are correct and you won\u2019t get anything out of discovery, but it is very unlikely, and not worth the risk. The probability of creating a better product by investing even a small amount of resources in testing is extraordinarily high. Simply, you cannot come up with a method of learning that replaces watching someone actually engage with your product.</p><p>\r\n\tThe eventual outcome of this learning and discovery is that throughout the product development process, you\u2019ll have the confidence to reject \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions. Continuing to explore new ideas and challenge existing assumptions will narrow the divide between what you think people will use and what they actually use. Then, you will have built a truly great product.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Glen Raven had the right attitude about discovery.

I\u2019ve always been a deep-thinker, trying to reach out and grasp some kind of greater understanding. Ironically, looking at the tiniest aspect of something can sometimes reveal something new in what we all consider to be the bigger picture. Engineering, philosophy, and science provide this opportunity more often than not.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I would be the programmer I am today if I didn\u2019t bother to look at the bottom-most levels of the tools I\u2019ve used in the past, and the ones that I choose to use today. It\u2019s that \u201cAha! So that\u2019s how it works\u201d moment that enables you to take the next step forward in your continued development; an education that forces you to constantly evolve as challenges are laid before you on a daily basis.</p><p>Learning design patterns has enabled me to provide myself with the tools I need in order to conquer these challenges. They have given me the ability to write my own libraries instead of relying upon whatever time-savers dot the web. Let\u2019s take <a href=\"http://restkit.org/\">RestKit</a> for example:</p><p>A library such as RestKit exists so as to provide iOS developers, like myself, a convenient framework with which to spawn asynchronous network connections in order to communicate with a remote service. For most people, there\u2019d be no reason to look deeper beyond the sentence I just wrote. Out-of-the-box, you have all the functionality you need to start hooking-up API calls in order to build an application that easily communicates with the cloud.</p><p>But for me, that isn\u2019t enough. I personally don\u2019t feel I\u2019m doing my best if I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. So, in that case, what would I need to write in order to achieve the same result? The following is my own implementation for an asynchronous networking solution:</p><ol>\r\n<li>A singleton dispatcher for network requests.</li><li>A generic request that can be configured by some metadata that is passed into it during initialization.</li><li>A command object that is constructed to store a reference to the caller of the asynchronous request as well as methods that trigger when certain events occur.</li><li>A URL factory that exists to dynamically generate URLs based upon the HTTP method invoked and the API called.</li><li>A mediator that utilizes loose coupling in order to target a specific HTTP method within the URL factory.</li><li>A generator that contains an aggregation of all URLs that can be possibly generated, organized by which API the URLs connect with.</li></ol><p id=\"attachment_4053\" style=\"width: 310px; text-align: center;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MB-Dissecting-Third-Party-Libraries.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4053\" alt=\"Network Communication Libraries\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MB-Dissecting-Third-Party-Libraries-300x285.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"285\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\">My simple network communication library<br>(only six classes!)</p><p>So, that\u2019s six classes total. I\u2019m pretty sure if you look at RestKit (or <a href=\"https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking\">AFNetworking</a>, or any other networking library) you\u2019ll find that it contains much more than six classes, but truthfully, you aren\u2019t going to need anything more than that.</p><p>This solution has served me quite well since I built it around six months ago. It is easy to maintain and re-use (only two of the classes require re-writing per project). Its simplicity is part of its appeal, and is an ethos I try to abide by when I develop applications. Hopefully, as you discover more about software design patterns, you\u2019ll not only find it easier to create your own tools, but also come to appreciate and embrace the elegance provided by simpler implementation.

        "body": "<p>I\u2019m not a programmer...more of a product developer who understands just enough code to be dangerous. About a month ago I graduated from <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/why-a-start-up-ceo-went-to-code-school\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\">code school</a> and after twelve weeks of intense training, my <a href=\"http://pladel.io/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\">two teammates</a> and I put ourselves through the challenge of designing a <a href=\"http://pladel.io/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\" target=\"_blank\">health app</a> in under two and half weeks. What we learned is something that all developers and UX designers know - to create a successful product, the discovery phase has to be thought out, well-planned and well implemented. Here I\u2019ll talk about leveraging lean startup methodology to build software and show exactly how we delivered it in the form of a mobile health app.</p><h4>Phase One: Discovery (3 days)</h4><p><em>Step One: Defining the Problem</em></p><p>The <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/you-cant-really-innovate-without-discovery\" target=\"_blank\">discovery phase</a> of the product development process is critical for uncovering the \u201creal\u201d problems that need to be solved. It\u2019s also important in helping define the initial target audience or user base. The initial product, or minimum viable product (MVP), will need to be tested with that audience or user base to learn as much as possible about them with as little effort as possible. More on this in a minute. Failing to select the correct audience and \u201cjobs\u201d they need to accomplish can kill the product's success. </p><p>The first step is to identify the problem. In our case Josh, our lead backend developer, explained that he was having trouble staying motivated and accountable to a health plan called the Primal Blueprint. It was a plan focused more on improving health than bench pressing 300 lbs. or running a three-hour marathon. It focused on improving sleep quality, eating well and moving enough.</p><p>After a couple months, he would get bored with his meal plan and return to eating poorly.  Josh also lacked awareness in regards to how he was performing on the plan...he was losing weight and feeling better...but was he sleeping enough? Was he moving enough during the day?  There was no definition of success. So we concluded that the best product to test (the MVP) was a health app.</p><p>As an exercise physiologist I try to keep up with the most recent research. Based upon some recent studies, the current thinking is that maintaining and improving one\u2019s health is not defined only by working out intensely for 30-60 minutes per day (although that is important) it\u2019s also defined by not being sedentary (i.e. resting your backside eight hours per day).  It\u2019s also key, especially when designing a health application, that you have someone on your team that understands the domain.  The more familiar you are with the subject matter the more depth and value you can typically add to a product.  With this in mind we decided to test our assumption that other people had these problems as well. MVP hypothesizing at work.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTAvMjAvMTIvMzMvNTAvODY5L1NjcmVlbl9TaG90XzIwMTRfMTBfMjBfYXRfMTIuMTguMzFfUE0ucG5nIl1d/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-20%20at%2012.18.31%20PM.png?sha=45c7afe6\"></p><p><em>Step Two: Understand Your Audience</em></p><p>Ideation can take on many forms, but when testing a minimum viable product, assumptions have to be made quickly and with a gut feeling. When Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn wanted to test the hypothesis that customers were willing to buy shoes online, he got right down to it. He didn\u2019t build a brand new website or ship in an entire stockroom of shoes, but instead took pictures of a local shoe store\u2019s inventory, posted the pictures online, bought the shoes from the store at full price, and sold them directly to customers. Like Swinburn, we assumed customer demand was present, and in this case it was the demand for a more involved health app they could use.</p><p>We had limited time (literally a day) to complete the hypothesis testing process. I did some basic research on Primal Blueprint, performed some basic audience research by viewing their forums and Facebook page, and had a short storyboarding session with the team.</p><p>Following the lean methodology process, we made a number of assumptions: </p><ul> \r\n<li>There were enough people on the Primal Blueprint plan that had problems similar to those Josh was experiencing</li></ul><ul> \r\n<li>The initial audience that had the most pain and was most likely to adopt the product early were age 22-30, male leaning, recent college graduates living in metropolitan areas and were Achiever Intellectual archetype (send me a message if you want to know more about this).</li><li>The audience was time constrained but would be willing to self report whether they ate healthy or not if it was simple</li><li>They had a wearable device or would be willing to purchase one so we could passively aggregate  their data and \u201cscore\u201d their progress</li></ul><p><em>Step Three: Market Assumptions</em></p><p>Potential customers must get involved to make sure there\u2019s interest and need in the product. Avoiding customers\u2019 input would lead to more work, more cost and...well...fat methodology. And no one wants that.</p><p>So after some general assumptions were made, we set off to test their validity.  We posted a simple five-question survey to all the forum members and Facebook followers of the Primal Blueprint. We received 19 completed surveys. Of those, 14 said they were either enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about the product and 12 said they either had a wearable device or would be willing to purchase one.  </p><p>Based on our limited time, we made the assumption that a larger sample would prove the same results (normally one would perform a much more extensive set of market research to improve confidence).  We also knew that over 250k copies of the Primal Blueprint had been sold and they had over 50k subscribers on their forum.  There was a large enough audience that had the problem to make it worthwhile to solve.  Three of our assumptions had passed enough to take the next steps but one did not. Out of the 14 respondents, 70% were age 30-45, female-leaning parents who lived in metropolitan areas.  Our initial assumption was age 22-30, male-leaning, recent college graduates living in metropolitan areas.  We stuck with the assumption that they were Achiever Intellectual archetype.</p><p>Redefining our assumptions about our audience based on what we learned from our product discovery phase affected our branding and some functionality of the final prototype. Had we not performed the discovery process and implemented lean methodology, we may have focused on a less engaged audience and wouldn\u2019t know what they needed or wanted. Ultimately, this would have decreased our likelihood for success.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul> \r\n<li>Start by figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and then develop a minimum viable product (MVP) to begin the process of learning as quickly as possible. </li><li>Make assumptions about what your customers\u2019 wants and needs are.</li><li>Get their feedback.</li></ul><p>Next month, I\u2019ll be expanding on the lean startup method and the next steps in designing and developing with this in mind. The real test is after the initial prototype is built, will people actually engage with it and how much?

        "body": "<p>In my never-ending quest to try to understand everything about everything, I eventually had to figure out how scheduling mechanisms (Threads) work within <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html\">Cocoa</a> (the framework for Mac OSX &amp; iOS Development). It isn\u2019t as simple as you\u2019d think. For example, a thread can be spawned and given an associated task which will be completed from start-to-finish. However, what about portions of your task that need to wait for a response before it can proceed further? What do you do with those?  In circumstances like these, Apple has included an event-processing mechanism called a \u201c<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/RunLoopManagement/RunLoopManagement.html\">Run Loop</a>\u201d, which simplifies the amount of work a programmer needs to do to account for event-driven code.</p><p>I previously wrote a post about building an <a href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/dissecting-third-party-libraries-through-design-patterns/\">asynchronous networking library</a>. This article will dive even further into an important part of what makes it work, \u201cRun Loops\u201d, which are integral to performing asynchronous tasks.</p><p>So, first, what is a run loop? Apple\u2019s documentation says:</p><p>\u201cRun loops are part of the fundamental infrastructure associated with threads. A run loop is an event processing loop that you use to schedule work and coordinate the receipt of incoming events. The purpose of a run loop is to keep your thread busy when there is work to do and put your thread to sleep when there is none.\u201d -Threading Programming Guide: \u201cRun Loops\u201d, Apple Inc.</p><p>So, let\u2019s explore this a little further: A \u201cthread\u201d (for those of you reading this who don\u2019t know) is a scheduling mechanism for queueing tasks to be processed by the CPU. These threads are managed by the operating system\u2019s \u201cscheduler\u201d, and given a place in line where they are eventually executed. In the context of a multiprocessor environment, you can execute threads \u201cconcurrently\u201d (at the same time). This allows software to perform certain time-consuming tasks in the background without slowing down the responsiveness of the user interface (what we call performing a task \u201casynchronously\u201d).</p><p>There can be some hurdles while performing tasks asynchronously (namely, the synchronization, \u201cre-coupling\u201d, of data), but this is a topic that can be discussed at-length in another article. For now, let\u2019s jump back to how run loops fit in.</p><p>In Cocoa and Cocoa-Touch development, run loops are the mechanism you will utilize to make sure your event-driven, asynchronous task properly responds to any activity that occurs during the lifespan of the thread it is operating within. If the events for the task are not allowed to occur, and aren\u2019t responded to, you risk not acquiring, or utilizing, the data you need to complete the intent of the task. Below is a sample class diagram for the structure of a threaded, asynchronous task:</p><ul><li>Thread (this can be spawned using NSThread, Grand-Central Dispatch, NSOperation, or \u201cperformSelectorInBackground:\u201d)</li><li>NSRunLoop/Task</li><li>Event-Driven Object (this is a class whose functionality requires time to process in order for events associated with it to occur. An example would be a running NSURLConnection object, or a socket)</li></ul><p>As you can see from above, the order of encapsulation begins with a thread, continues up the stack with the NSRunLoop and Task associated with it, and then finally into the context of the object which is utilizing the RunLoop. This dependency makes sure that the task has both its own space to operate, and the means to make sure its instructions are fully carried out.</p><p>To schedule your event-driven object/class within a run loop be sure to call the method below:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> [&lt;object/class&gt; scheduleInRunLoop:[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] forMode: NSRunLoopCommonModes];\r\n</pre><p>Simply scheduling the event-driven object (within your task) inside the current thread\u2019s run loop isn\u2019t enough. You have to tell the run loop when to start polling for events. This can be done with:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] run];\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tor</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes beforeDate:&lt;a Date&gt;];\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tor</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate:&lt;a Date&gt;];\r\n</pre><p>Keep in mind that once you begin running the run loop, events/methods will only fire if they are included within the scope of that method call. Thus, if this portion of your task is written as:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> [runLoop \"run\" method call];\r\n[another method call];\r\n</pre><p>The following method will never get called while the run loop is running. Whereas if the task is written as:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> [a local method call];\r\n[runLoop \"run\" method call];\r\n</pre><p>The method within the scope of the run loop\u2019s \u201crun\u201d method call will be performed during the run loop\u2019s duration. This is important if you wish to manually exit the thread via some kind of \u201ctime-out\u201d mechanism (usually implemented through a timer, or \u201cNSTimer\u201d, in this case).</p><p>If implemented correctly you should be able to witness your application\u2019s responsiveness during asynchronously-performed tasks (via the class\u2019 delegate methods, or whatever \u201cObserver\u201d pattern you\u2019ve implemented). Congratulations!</p><p>Be sure to check out Apple\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/Introduction/Introduction.html\">Threading Programming Guide</a>\u201d for future reference, or if you have any issues.</p><p>As always, good luck with your implementation of multi-threaded design!

Broadcast communications are messages not directed at a specific user or group of users. That is, using Twitter as a bulletin board as opposed to a mode of dyadic (two-way) communication will constrain your number of followers. In turn, <em>directed communications</em> (e.g. replies, \u2018@\u2019 mentions, and favorites directed at someone else) have a positive effect on follower growth. Even so, the positive influence of directed communications is not as strong as the negative effect of broadcast communications. Twitter is a conversation platform, evidenced by the marked differences in the effects of communication types on follower growth. Engagement on a one-to-one level between users is the great benefit of social media, why wouldn\u2019t you harness that?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3399\" alt=\"2\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"320\"></a><br>\r\n\tResearchers also found that expressing negativity is the second most important factor in stunting follower growth. While talking smack may be a treasured pasttime for close friend groups, the relatively weak relationships found on Twitter makes spewing virtual venom a big no-no. Want to further alienate potential new-followers? Use too many hashtags. The median ratio of hashtags per Tweet during the recorded periods was .13. Respect the power of the tag,&nbsp;if you\u2019re using more than one-two hashtags per 10 Tweets, you\u2019re&nbsp;\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKIpCPS-oZc\">doing too much</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\tRest assured that \r\n\t<em style=\"background-color: initial;\">message content</em> variables were not all doom and gloom. Both spreading informational content and writing Tweets worth retweeting were significant predictors of growth. Hutto et al. (2013) define informational content as Tweets containing a URL, \u201cRT\u201d, \u201cMT\u201d, \u201cHT\u201d, or \u201cvia\u201d (MT meaning modified Tweet and HT meaning heard through). Unfortunately, the researchers do not provide a formula for creating top Tweets, though being re-elected President <a title=\"apparently helps\" href=\"https://2012.twitter.com/en/golden-tweets.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">apparently helps</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\tWhile the follower counts of Twitter\u2019s informer class are likely to grow, the platform\u2019s more self obsessed users, or \u201cmeformers\u201d are not as lucky. Although users were found to Tweet about themselves more often (41% \u201cmeformer\u201d compared to 26% \u201cinformer\u201d), informational content is 30 times more effective in attracting new followers. Yes, 30 times. So try and avoid the \u201chumblebrag\u201d. Also, start dropping knowledge or RTing, because new potential followers won\u2019t care about your self-referential blathering.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeMande\">@JoeMande</a> I'm gonna go ahead and call <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tthb&amp;src=hash\">#tthb</a>(triple threat humble brag)\r\n\t</p><p>\r\n\t\t&mdash; Chelsea Peretti (@ChelseaVPeretti) \r\n\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChelseaVPeretti/statuses/26582494892\">October 6, 2010</a>\r\n\t</p></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t\tThanks to Joe Mande and Chelsea Peretti respectively, for demonstrating a proper #humblebrag and an appropriate public shaming for doing so.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3370\" title=\"The follower of my follower is my friend\" alt=\"The follower of my follower is my friend\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/31.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"320\"></p><p>\r\n\tWhile Hutto el al. (2013) spent relatively less ink discussing the effect of \r\n\t<em>network structure </em>on follower growth, the researchers did communicate that greater network overlap between a user and their current followers increases the likelihood of a user attracting new followers. Part of the influence of network overlap (i.e. the number of neighbors users have in common) on follower growth may be associated with the idea of <em>triadic closure</em>. If my follower (B) RTs me (A), and my follower\u2019s follower (X) views and likes the content of that RT, my follower\u2019s follower (X) is more likely to follow me (A). The potential for X to follow A grows the more X is exposed to positive or informational content by A. If multiple users which A and X have in common spread content produced by A, the potential for X to follow A increases. According to Hutto et al. the relationship between A, B, and X achieves \u201ccognitive balance\u201d when all three are connected.</p><p>\r\n\tThe relatively simple calculations of users\u2019 \r\n\t<em>in-link reciprocity</em> and <em>attention status</em> can alert users whether they need to adjust aspects of their social media strategy. In-link reciprocity is a ratio of a user\u2019s followers, specifically which of their followers a user follows in return. The attention-status ratio is the proportion of a user\u2019s followers to the accounts a user is following. So, in-link reciprocity [User's Followers: User Follows/Follows User] and attention status [Follows User /User Follows] were significant predictors of follower growth with medians of .25 and 1.19 respectively.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\t<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3371\" title=\"Popular is as popular does\" alt=\"Popular is as popular does\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/41.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"320\"><br>\r\nWithout unpacking the statistical explanation for why higher attention status and in-link reciprocity ratios predict follower growth, I\u2019ll offer my understanding as a relative layperson. Both ratios signal the symmetry, or asymmetry of the relationships between Twitter users. As noted in Golder and Yardi (2010) attention is a limited resource. The very notion of popularity is that more people are aware of the popular individual than he or she can attend to on a regular basis. When applied to Twitter, the higher the ratio of followers a user has compared to accounts they follow (attention-status ratio), the more popular the individual. Based on the research of Hutto et al., the higher a user\u2019s attention-status ratio the greater the likelihood a user will attract new followers. The lesson: popular kids will continue to grow in popularity by virtue of being popular, it\u2019s like high school never ended. However, if a user follows their new followers, the potential for attracting new followers increases as well.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\tGolder and Yardi compare the reciprocal nature of following one\u2019s followers as akin to repaying a favor. Through repaying follows, users can solidify social media\u2019s relatively weak bonds and protect themselves against the dreaded unfollowing. Be mindful however, that increases in attention status ratio have a greater effect on attracting new followers than increasing in-link reciprocity. In other terms, have more followers than friends.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\tTwitter\u2019s influence can hardly be confined to data sets. Fortunately, how we interact with each other on the platform is more quantifiable as evidenced in the research of Hutto et al. If you want a quick list of tips for increasing your Twitter followers, look at \r\n\t<a title=\"this article\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2013/02/27/grow-your-twitter-followers-by-being-nice-and-informative/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> or maybe <a title=\"this one\" href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/205411/science-reveals-what-really-increases-twitter-followers/\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>. But instead of taking the path of numbered lists, read the <a title=\"original research\" href=\"http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/follow_chi13_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">original research</a> elaborating on the network structure variables. The well worn trope about being an informed consumer, well, it\u2019s more than a figure of speech especially as&nbsp;Twitter is concerned. In a relatively short amount of time, mastery of 140 characters or less became an influential manner of gaining social capital. Individuals unknown before 2006 have the opportunity to become \u201cmicro-celebrities\u201d, and both&nbsp;established and up-and-coming brands have access to a less expensive marketing channel.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n\tIf you\u2019re not Tweeting, review the research and start. If you\u2019re already thousands of Tweets deep into the platform, use the research to refine your technique.

        "body": "<p>In the early 90s we experienced a revolution in desktop publishing and were on the cusp of changing the way people shared information and communicated. I was a sophomore in high school and was a member of our newspaper. At the time, I was learning Adobe PageMaker and thought, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool to move from cut and paste on a light table to running our design and production from my Mac?\u201d I convinced our teacher to get us a few Macintosh SEs to help innovate our process. Switching to desktop publishing helped us grow from a bi-monthly newspaper to a monthly newsmagazine and reduced costs significantly. It was my first foray into understanding how software and technology could help drive innovation.</p><p>Fast forward twenty years\u2026as the cofounder of two software start-ups I learned quickly that you could end up running on fumes if you don\u2019t pace your development resources well. As a domain expert in the health and exercise sciences, I didn\u2019t always have enough programming acumen to communicate my vision and users\u2019 needs to our developers. I was also handicapped when meeting with potential customers who had a technical team with questions regarding integration and additional features. It required me to bring a developer to the conversation to field questions and help us understand the potential knots and opportunities.</p><p><strong>Enter Code School</strong></p><p>When I shared with friends and family that I was considering immersing myself in code for 12-weeks I received some pretty interesting looks\u2026mostly confused. The underlying theme was, \u201cwhy the heck do you need to learn to write code\u2026can\u2019t you just hire developers?\u201d</p><p>This is a good question. I would argue that the landscape of entrepreneurship and product development for startups and early stage software companies is changing. Those that lack the technical acumen to communicate with their development team and potential clients and the ability to prototype ideas before even hiring talent are at a disadvantage.</p><p>This isn\u2019t to say that you have to be able to develop robust, fully functioning, bug-free applications using test-driven development. You should, however, be able to understand what your developers are talking about when creating your MVP or adding additional features. This can help bring your product to market more quickly and your development team will probably respect the fact that you understand the product and constraints from their lens and not expect the world in the first release.</p><p>I didn't enter code school for the same reason many others do. My ambition was not to become a full time developer or programmer. I wanted to gain enough expertise to prototype basic applications and communicate more effectively with developers. The goal was to improve my ability to help design simple but elegant products that solve big problems.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDkvMTIvMTIvMzYvMjYvNTMzL0FuZHJldy5qcGciXV0/Andrew.jpg?sha=3b61bc1f\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDkvMTIvMTIvMzcvMDAvMzE1L0FuZHJldzIuanBnIl1d/Andrew2.jpg?sha=4201afee\"></p><p><strong>My Experience</strong></p><p>A little over twelve weeks ago I started <a href=\"http://academy.smashingboxes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">code school</a> in Durham, NC. It was not unlike the first few months of getting a start up off the ground, intense and exhausting, but with some key differences.</p><p>Building a technology \u201cstartup\u201d is like being the head coach of a football team. You are constantly leading, designing, managing, strategizing and selling. You\u2019re supported but alone at the same time.</p><p>Code school, is more like trying to set a personal record in a 10k\u2026you start out setting a fast pace making up as much ground as you can. Then you back off a bit, knowing if you maintain that pace you may crack. Finally, you try to pick it up at the end when the finish line is in sight. All the while there are people supporting you (family, classmates and community).</p><p>The first month was by far the most challenging. Eighty to one hundred hour weeks were expected if you wanted to keep up. At the end of 10 weeks of learning and hammering out code, we were given two weeks to produce a final product. I was lucky enough to be partnered with two talented developers and we designed a fully functioning app named <a href=\"http://pladel.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Pladel</a> (a mobile application that provides one simple score to measure your health and takes the guesswork out of what to eat). We all agreed that if we had it to do over we would have ripped out most of the ruby code and served an API from a Rails framework and built the front end using either Angular or Ember (two front-end frameworks) to give us more flexibility. I mention this because that is one of the things you learn in code school\u2026how to understand what to build more efficiently to create better customer experiences and ultimately a more scalable business.</p><p>Just like learning to use Adobe PageMaker to rough out our layout for my high school newspaper helped me better communicate with my designer, my ability to code is now allowing me to prototype apps and communicate more effectively with developers. This has been a significant asset in my new role helping start ups to Fortune 100 companies innovate great products and services at <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smashing Boxes</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions or are thinking about going to code school, don\u2019t hesitate to connect with me.

We know that a lot of people are thinking about trying to learn how to code (which is totally awesome). It is definitely not too late for anyone to learn, but most people have no idea where to even start. If this sounds familiar, this is the post for you. Since everyone needs a website or has an app idea, the focus of this post is on programming languages that can be used for web or mobile app development</p><p>\r\n\tFirst, what is front-end vs. back-end development? Front-end web development describes the visual, user-friendly layer of the website that the user interacts with and is used to collect inputs. Back-end web development uses the inputs that come from the front-end and is composed of servers, applications, and databases. Information is stored by the application in the database, which lives on the server. Mobile development incorporates both front- and back-end development components, but is mostly front-end.</p><p>\r\n\tA great analogy from a <a href=\"http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-front-end-web-development/\">General Assembly</a> front-end developer explains that if a website is a car, then the internal components of the car that you can\u2019t see, but that make it run would be the back-end, and the things you can touch/use/hear to make the car move or that make it cool/fun are the front-end.</p><p>\r\n\tLet\u2019s dive in to the fun part, what are the best tutorials to use to learn how to code?</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Front-end Development Languages</h3><h5 dir=\"ltr\"><strong><u>HTML/CSS</u></strong></h5><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p>\r\n\tHTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to make websites pretty. You can\u2019t go wrong with learning HTML because every website builds upon HTML elements, which define document elements (e.g. headers, titles, paragraphs).

        "body": "<p>Last month, we introduced you to the practice and service that is <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/growth-engineering-growth-hacking-grown-up\" target=\"_blank\">Growth Engineering</a>. What we didn\u2019t tell you is that Google Analytics is a HUGE component of growth engineering. While you don\u2019t have to be GA certified to be in this industry, it definitely helps. And to become certified, you have to take the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) Exam. So, this is where I come in.</p><p>You may have heard the GAIQ Exam can be pretty difficult to pass. Well Google released an updated version of the test in <a href=\"http://www.pr2020.com/blog/passing-the-new-google-analytics-iq-exam-2014\" target=\"_blank\">January 2014</a> and along with it came a whole slew of new questions, new answers and more confusing verbiage. Awesome!</p><p>If you were anything like me when I was first preparing for it, you\u2019re probably in the process of trying to find out as much information as possible about the test before taking the plunge. When I took the test, I was a little nervous about taking it because I am a terrible test taker. I read every article, blog post, and forum I could find that mentioned the test, and some were helpful and some not so much. But I passed on my first time taking it and now want to pass on my (study tips) onto you. In this post I will address the test format, study resources, and test tips. Hopefully this resource will save you some time and stress and point you in the right direction before you take it.</p><p><strong>Test Format</strong></p><p>Quick facts about the GAIQ:</p><ul> \r\n<li>Costs $50 to take</li><li>70 multiple-choice questions</li><li>90-minute time limit (you can pause the test as many times as you like, but the time expires five days after starting it)</li><li>It is an open book test (don\u2019t be misled; this doesn\u2019t make it much easier)</li><li>80% is the passing score (you can\u2019t miss more than 14 questions)</li><li>You receive a certificate and your name appears in <a href=\"https://www.starttest.com/9.0.0.0/searchcert.aspx?cmd=start&amp;program=googleanalytics&amp;type=consumer&amp;target=center&amp;limit=search\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s database of Qualified Individuals</a> (you can look me up!)</li><li>Certification expires after 18 months (and then we get to start this whole process over, WOO!)</li></ul><p>You\u2019ll pay and take the test in <a href=\"https://google.starttest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s Testing Center</a>. If you get below an 80% you will have to wait 15 days before you can try again. However, after the test (pass or fail) Google will provide you with areas you need to improve upon. </p><p><strong>Study Resources</strong></p><p>I want to offer you my three \u201cmust study\u201d resources:</p><ol> \r\n<li><a href=\"https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s Analytics Academy</a> is the first place you should start. I believe this was once called Conversion University (so if you see other blogs telling you to use CU just know they are the same thing). Google\u2019s Analytics Advocate, <a href=\"http://cutroni.com/blog/about-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Cutroni</a>, walks you through an overview of Google Analytics in the <a href=\"https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course01\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Analytics Fundamentals</a> course. Personally, I think this is the best resource because the videos are easy to understand and there are assessments after each lesson.</li></ol><p style=\"margin-left: 60px;\">Resource Tip: Each lesson has a text version. I downloaded those and made a PDF pseudo-textbook for the test. This will cut down on searching for the answer to a tricky question.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 60px;\">- They now have more lessons with assessments that focus more attention on subjects covered in the fundamentals course, e.g. Ecommerce</p><p>2.     Once you complete the free course and the final assessment, you should check out this <a href=\"http://www.googleanalyticstest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Google Analytics Practice Test</a>. The practice test has more than 200 practice questions and you can pick what topics you want to study, e.g. Goals &amp; Funnels or Internal Site Search. It was developed by <a href=\"http://www.e-nor.com/google-analytics-training-course/instructor/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Eric Fettman</a>; the man is a Google Analytics genius. Many say that the practice test is harder than the actual test and I would have to agree. It reinforces your knowledge and shows what you may need to study more before taking the real test. Definitely check it out.</p><p>3.     If you are not a fan of watching videos and would rather read to obtain this knowledge, you should check out <a href=\"http://www.jenssorensen.co.uk/2010/07/google-analytics-individual-qualification-exam-test-notes/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Jens Sorensen</a>\u2019s analytics blog post. But be prepared, it is packed full of information and is extremely lengthy for a blog post. Also fair warning, he wrote this post in 2010 and while still a very good resource, Google has removed some of the topics that you will see on the test (e.g. _utmv cookie).</p><p>I strongly urge you to check out/do these first before attempting to take the test. I found that cheat sheets were great for finding answers quickly and printed them out to have in front of me during the test:</p><ul> \r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.blastam.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/handy-google-analytics-reference-guide-80-tips/\" target=\"_blank\">Blast Handy Google Analytics Reference Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/temp/intersec-handout.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Portent Interactive Google Analytics Cheat Sheet 2</a></li></ul><p>If you\u2019re brave you can try taking the test with just these. But I suggest that you study the first three resources. </p><p><strong>Test Tips:</strong></p><ol> \r\n<li>Practice \r\nIf you don\u2019t have a Google Analytics account, you need to make one. This will allow you to play around with the interfaces and it will give you a better understanding of the lessons. It also is great to have open during the test as a reference.</li><li>Know the types of Questions\r\nWhat stressed me out most about the test was that I didn\u2019t know what the format of the questions were going to be like. In all the resources I found, they mentioned that the questions are multiple choice but never gave more detail as to exactly what type of multiple choice questions they are (single answer? multiple answer? all of the above?, WHAT?!). In the course and practice test there were a lot of \u201cSelect all that apply\u201d multiple choice questions. Well, I hate to say it, but they\u2019re also on the real test. The test questions vary between true/false, single answer, and select all that apply. Additionally, there are either four or five answer choices for each question.</li><li>Pay attention to time\r\nYou have 90 minutes to complete the test, and the countdown clock in the top right corner of the test window doesn\u2019t let you forget it. You have about a minute and thirty seconds for each question. No pressure, right? However, the pause button is the saving grace. If you get stumped you can pause the test, which will blur out the question and you scan through your resources to find the answer. If you rather not pause the test and continue trucking through you can mark questions you\u2019re not sure of. There is a scrolling list of questions on the right side of the window and you can easily navigate back to the marked ones.</li><li>Open Resources\r\nSince the test is open book, you can have all your handy resources open in other windows/tabs. I had these three open while taking the test: <a href=\"http://gaconfig.com/google-analytics-event-tracking/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics Configuration Tool</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">URL Builder</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s Analytics Help Center</a>. Some other blogs say to have an easy RegEx (Regular Expression) <a href=\"http://scriptular.com/\" target=\"_blank\">generator</a> open. I didn\u2019t have any RegEx questions, but better safe than sorry. </li></ol><p>If I missed something that you were looking for you may want to check out these other resources about the test:</p><p><a href=\"http://moz.com/blog/google-analytics-certification-how-to-pass-the-gaiq-test\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics Certification and How to Pass the GAIQ Test</a> - Fantastic general guide for the GAIQ test it also has a practice test questions that you can download.  </p><p><a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/blog/web-analytics/gaiq-study-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\">GAIQ Study Sheet</a> - This is an older study sheet but it still has a lot topics that the GAIQ covers.</p><p><a href=\"http://viget.com/advance/how-to-pass-the-google-analytics-iq-test-in-two-days-zero-to-hero\" target=\"_blank\">How to Pass the Google Analytics IQ Test in Two Days: Zero to Hero</a> - Great resource guide for the GAIQ especially if you\u2019re trying to pass quickly.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.firstclickconsulting.com.au/blog/the-complete-guide-to-studying-for-the-google-analytics-test/\" target=\"_blank\">The Complete Guide to studying for the Google Analytics IQ Exam</a> - Awesome guide for studying and has great advice from experts. </p><p>Hopefully this has given you a better understanding or confidence about the test.

        "body": "<p>In my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/apples-swift-a-developers-first-impression\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a> right after WWDC14, I compared Swift to Objective-C. We received some very good feedback but one question in particular really caught my attention: \u201cWould anyone recommend learning Swift or start with Objective-C first? I feel that learning C would give me a better understanding of the internal workings and will lead to better code, but it will take much more time and has a steeper learning curve.\u201d</p><p>To answer this question and perhaps the question of many potential iOS developers, I feel that it would be better to start off learning Objective-C before Swift. Let me explain my reasoning.</p><p>Obj-C is an established language. It made its appearance in 1983 making it a little over 30 years old! While Swift may look great it is continuing to evolve and mature over time. Apple\u2019s App Store contains over 1.2 million apps to download and most all of these apps are written in Obj-C. If someone were trying to break into the iOS development industry, hiring managers will be looking for development experience in Obj-C to help maintain their existing apps. It will take time for the majority of iOS developers to completely switch to using Swift for iOS development.</p><p>Because Obj-C has been around for so long, you will find that most of the iOS development related questions asked on sites such as StackOverflow are answered with Obj-C code. Many tutorials are also written using Obj-C. Some well-known tutorial sites like <a href=\"http://www.raywenderlich.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Wenderlich.com</a> are moving to use only Swift for future content which is great, but all the past tutorials are written in Obj-C.</p><p>You will learn Obj-C a lot faster, and after gaining a good understanding of it, learning Swift will be a piece of cake. Swift contains a lot of modern features that will make it more versatile, more concise, and nicer to read and write, but it\u2019s still in its infancy. For the next several years, it will be important for professional iOS developers to have a good grasp of both Objective-C and Swift. One could definitely understand Swift without a good grip on Obj-C but if starting out with iOS development it's better to start with Obj-C. Since Obj-C is a completely different language than Swift it's not required to know, it but if you are thinking about getting into iOS development, it is definitely recommended to learn first. Once you\u2019re familiar with the iOS patterns used to develop apps, you can use exactly the same patterns while writing in both languages, so moving from one language to the other is just a matter of learning the syntax. With Swift, you\u2019re developing apps using the same framework and APIs as you would with Obj-C. I have found that after getting the syntax down, it becomes very simple to write the functionality you want for your app.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Initializing a UIView with size 200x200 and a blue background:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDgvMjcvMDkvMjIvMzAvMzgvU2NyZWVuX1Nob3RfMjAxNF8wOF8yN19hdF85LjIxLjU1X0FNLnBuZyJdXQ/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-27%20at%209.21.55%20AM.png?sha=2f4ea16f\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><p>Keep in mind this is just my opinion, but it\u2019s definitely worth researching both languages and eventually using both for better app development.</p><p>There are lots of options for learning Obj-C on your own.

        "body": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/google-tag-manager-and-event-tracking\">previous post</a>, I discussed how Google Tag Manager (GTM) will save you and your developers time tracking events on your website. Tracking events provides valuable insights into user interactions with specific elements on your site. These insights can be used to evaluate user behavior, assess whether users are behaving as expected, and develop ideas for testing if the behavior is unexpected. Using the same PDF download tracking example as before, we\u2019ll now take a deeper look into how GTM works and the setup involved in creating a tag. </p>\n\n<p>To do this, we\u2019re going to track this generic PDF button that has a link to our 2014 Widgets PDF. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OBvLlga.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s assume that you have created a GTM container and already placed it immediately after the &#39;&lt; body &gt;&#39; tag of your site. When we first open our GTM container we will see that we have no tags in it. Perfect, this means we have a clean working environment and have freedom to create new tags.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UzpTkLf.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>The first tag that we are going to make is a <strong>Link Listener</strong>. This <strong>Tag</strong> is going to listen for any clicks that happen on the page. To create a Tag, click on the <strong>New</strong> button and select <strong>Tag</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6IGK7OD.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>First, we need to name our Tag and in this case we\u2019re going to write \u201cExample Link Listener.\u201d Be sure to label anything you create in GTM clearly so that other users know what the Tag does or is tracking. </p>\n\n<p>After you enter a clearly defined name, click on the <strong>Tag Type</strong> drop down menu. It will open up a long list of Tag Types. Maneuver your mouse down to Event Listener and select the <strong>Link Click Listener</strong>. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ajDRQxH.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>Great, we have just created our first tag but we are not finished quite yet. In the top right corner you will see <strong>Firing Rules</strong>. This is actually what causes the Tag to be fired.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/B4JE9dj.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>We are going to add our first Rule to our Link Listener Tag. Luckily, Google has predefined the rule we will be using for our Link Listener Tag. The <strong>All Pages Rule</strong> means this Tag will fire on all of our web pages. Once we have saved this rule on on Link Listener we can move on to our next Tag, an Event <strong>Tag</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/P50xHLd.png\" alt=\"Image of Yaktocat\"></p>\n\n<p>We want to select Create New Tag and make sure it is labeled clearly. In this example we\u2019ve named it, \u201cExample PDF Download.\u201d This time we are going to hover over the <strong>Google Analytics</strong> tab and select <strong>Universal Analytics</strong>. (If you are not running Universal Analytics you need to select Classic.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EQ9WLHX.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>Once Universal Analytics is selected, scroll down and enter your Google Analytics Tracking Code ID.

For the PDF Download Tag to fire the event must contain a gtm.linkClick, which it does. We want the Tag to fire if the element class contains \u201cbutton\u201d in the class. And just in case other buttons have the same class name we want the element ID to contain \u201cPDF\u201d in it. If any of those parameters are false, the Tag will not fire.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rijfuBL.png\" alt=\"GoogleTagManagerTutorial\"></p>\n\n<p>Click save and you will see your Tags in the container draft.

Many times it is not as straightforward as this. For example, many developers do not like using IDs in their code, in which case you will need to find another way to get the name of the specific PDF a user downloaded in your Label field. In such instances we would use the element url or {{element url}} macro to return different labels. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this post has helped you with the complexities of Event Tagging and GTM. <strong>On Google+ or LinkedIn?</strong> Follow us <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Smashingboxes/posts\">+SmashingBoxes</a> and join us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/smashing-boxes\">LinkedIn</a> to get updates on more articles like this.</p>\n",

        "markdown": "In my [previous post](http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/google-tag-manager-and-event-tracking), I discussed how Google Tag Manager (GTM) will save you and your developers time tracking events on your website. Tracking events provides valuable insights into user interactions with specific elements on your site. These insights can be used to evaluate user behavior, assess whether users are behaving as expected, and develop ideas for testing if the behavior is unexpected. Using the same PDF download tracking example as before, we\u2019ll now take a deeper look into how GTM works and the setup involved in creating a tag. \r\n\r\nTo do this, we\u2019re going to track this generic PDF button that has a link to our 2014 Widgets PDF. \r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/OBvLlga.png)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s assume that you have created a GTM container and already placed it immediately after the '< body >' tag of your site. When we first open our GTM container we will see that we have no tags in it. Perfect, this means we have a clean working environment and have freedom to create new tags.\r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/UzpTkLf.png)\r\n\r\nThe first tag that we are going to make is a **Link Listener**. This **Tag** is going to listen for any clicks that happen on the page. To create a Tag, click on the **New** button and select **Tag**.\r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/6IGK7OD.png)\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to name our Tag and in this case we\u2019re going to write \u201cExample Link Listener.\u201d Be sure to label anything you create in GTM clearly so that other users know what the Tag does or is tracking. \r\n\r\nAfter you enter a clearly defined name, click on the **Tag Type** drop down menu. It will open up a long list of Tag Types. Maneuver your mouse down to Event Listener and select the **Link Click Listener**. \r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/ajDRQxH.png)\r\n\r\nGreat, we have just created our first tag but we are not finished quite yet. In the top right corner you will see **Firing Rules**. This is actually what causes the Tag to be fired.  \r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/B4JE9dj.png)\r\n\r\nWe are going to add our first Rule to our Link Listener Tag. Luckily, Google has predefined the rule we will be using for our Link Listener Tag. The **All Pages Rule** means this Tag will fire on all of our web pages. Once we have saved this rule on on Link Listener we can move on to our next Tag, an Event **Tag**.\r\n\r\n![Image of Yaktocat](http://i.imgur.com/P50xHLd.png)\r\n\r\nWe want to select Create New Tag and make sure it is labeled clearly. In this example we\u2019ve named it, \u201cExample PDF Download.\u201d This time we are going to hover over the **Google Analytics** tab and select **Universal Analytics**. (If you are not running Universal Analytics you need to select Classic.)\r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/EQ9WLHX.png)\r\n\r\nOnce Universal Analytics is selected, scroll down and enter your Google Analytics Tracking Code ID. This is UA-XXXXXXX in your Google Analytics account and is what links your tag info to your events reports.  \r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/G0TQtjw.png)\r\n\r\nNote: If you create a {{GA Tracking Code}} macro then you don\u2019t have to enter your ID in each time you make a new event tag. Check out GTM expert Simo Ahava\u2019s [post](http://www.simoahava.com/analytics/macro-guide-google-tag-manager/#7) to see how to do this.\r\n\r\nOnce you have typed your GA ID into the text field, scroll down till you see the **Track Type** drop down selector. It will have pageview selected as the default but we are going to edit that field. \r\n\r\n![GoogleTagManagerTutorial](http://i.imgur.com/4O5u03g.png)\r\n\r\nSelect **Event** as what we want to track.

        "body": "<h3>The Problem:</h3><p>As a general rule, you don\u2019t see event-based audio in the browser, or at least not outside of some embedded flash object or popup ad. Gone are the days when you\u2019d hear that crisp IE \u201cclick\u201d sound every time you clicked a link. No more do we jump for the volume controls when we mistakenly navigate to a page with a MIDI rendition of \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d set to auto play in the background. Most sites don\u2019t even set embedded videos to start automatically. You can see why the question of how best to implement it doesn\u2019t come up very often.</p><p>A recent client project centered around gamifying the college entrance process called for event-driven audio in some of the interactive activities. This is one of the few contexts where I would argue audio events have a place. Music and sound effects play a big role in conveying information about the game state to the player. Still, building games in the browser with native code remains a touchy process, and the more browsers you try to support the touchier it gets. In this case, we wanted it all. Everything from iPad to IE8 had to provide the same interactive experience.</p><p>Normally the obvious option would be to throw one of the myriad Flash-based audio players on the page and be done with it, but the iPad can\u2019t stomach Flash. Besides, we like to live on the bleeding edge here and I didn\u2019t want to submit to the <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag unless it was the only option.</p><p>The HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element is still messy at best. Browser audio APIs are improving and moving towards a unified spec but the chart of compatible formats still reads like a pick-three of audio file extensions, with no two browsers picking the same three.</p><h3>What\u2019s Out There:</h3><p>In doing research for this project I came across a lot of tutorials, snippets and plugins that claimed to allow you to use the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag with impunity. Almost all of these were built using multiple file formats for each audio file and a Flash fallback for older browsers. Most were also meant to be used for embedding songs, podcasts and the like. Of the ones I tested out, the simplest implementations didn\u2019t provide a way to control the player programmatically and the more complex packages took a lot of configuration and had a lot of moving pieces.</p><p>The Flash fallback route was really the only option for supporting such a wide range of browsers but I wanted a middle-of-the-road solution that would bark on command but wouldn\u2019t attempt to manage my entire MP3 collection for me. Enter <a href=\"http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/\" target=\"_blank\">audio.js</a>.</p><p>The audio.js package consists of four files:</p><ul>\r\n<li>audio.min.js</li><li>audiojs.swf</li><li>player-graphics.gif</li><li>index.css</li></ul><p>It\u2019s lightweight to say the least and was the quickest to get up and running. It works by creating a JavaScript wrapper around the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element that handles all browser discrepancies and allows you to use code like this:</p>\r\n<pre>&lt;audio src=\"/mp3/juicy.mp3\" preload=\"auto\" /&gt;</pre><p>For browsers without &lt;audio&gt; support of some kind, it defaults to the Flash player as expected, but the UI is all built with HTML and CSS and updated via JavaScript, so the user will see the same player no matter what their browser supports. Player appearance was admittedly not the biggest issue here since it would be hidden most of the time but it was one less thing to worry about.</p><p>What about browser support? The audio.js site claims</p><ul>\r\n<li>Mobile Safari&nbsp;(iOS 3+)</li><li>Android&nbsp;(2.2+, w/Flash)</li><li>Safari&nbsp;(4+)</li><li>Chrome&nbsp;(7+)</li><li>Firefox&nbsp;(3+, w/ Flash)</li><li>Opera&nbsp;(10+, w/ Flash)</li><li>IE&nbsp;(6, 7, 8, w/ Flash)</li></ul><p>An impressive list given the API fragmentation. Flash is listed as caveat more often than not but with JavaScript hooks to control the player instance I didn\u2019t have to worry about what type of player&nbsp; was being loaded in order to play a file.</p><p>It was love on <code>$(document).ready()</code>. But that doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t have our occasional fights. It took me a little while to get my head around the available methods because there is no detailed documentation available (however, the <a href=\"http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/docs/\" target=\"blank\">annotated source</a> is clean and concise). When testing in IE, I was plagued with an \u201cObject doesn\u2019t support this property or method\u201d error for a while that had to do with how I was procedurally loading the audio files. A few hurdles, but nothing to put me off for good.</p><p>There may be better audio solutions out there but this is one of the simplest and most functional I\u2019ve seen. It plays the audio by hook or by crook with minimal markup and access to player controls in JavaScript when needed. audio.js is definitely going in the resources folder for now.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

I've started working on a Rails template which <a href=\"https://github.com/reedlaw/rails-clean-architecture\">you can fork on Github</a> and will describe briefly what I've done here.</p><h3>The Rails Template</h3><p>\r\n\tRails has a basic, but quite usable, \r\n\t<a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html\">API for app creation</a>. The blog post, <a href=\"http://technology.stitchfix.com/blog/2014/01/06/rails-app-templates/\">Rails Application Templates</a>, by Dave Copeland of Stitch Fix was of enormous help in getting me started writing a Rails template. For now, I want to keep it fairly standard and familiar for Rails developers to use, so I kept the directory structure intact. The major changes include:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>Completely change the Gemfile by removing unnecessary gems such as jbuilder, sqlite, and sdoc and adding gems like hashie, pg, and tilt. These choices are debatable of course, but in keeping with the opinionated nature of Rails, I decided to pick these defaults.\r\n\t\r\n<ul>\r\n\t\t\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/intridea/hashie\">Hashie</a> is a collection of Hash extensions that work very well for creating data objects to be passed between interactors and views.</li>\t\t\r\n<li>The pg gem is included simply because I feel PostgreSQL is the right way to begin a project.</li>\t\t\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt\">Tilt</a> is a gem that will hopefully enable sharing views between Rails and Javascript frameworks. Tilt enables multiple templating engines, including Handlebars, which is widely supported among Javascript frameworks. This aspect of Clean Architecture is still experimental as I describe below.</li>\t</ul></li>\t\r\n<li>Create two new generators, one for entities and one for interactors. These are invoked just like Rails standard generators (e.g. \"rails generate entity <em>name</em>\"). They also generate a spec file in spec/entities/<em>name</em>_spec.rb.</li>\t\r\n<li>Added a spec_helper.rb and provided some shared examples for entities and interactors.</li>\t\r\n<li>Revamp the controller generator to create the type of controller actions that are common to Clean Architecture-style apps. See the example below.</li>\t\r\n<li>TODO: create generators for repositories and Handlebars templates.</li></ul><h3>Clean Controllers</h3>\r\n<pre>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\r\n  respond_to :html\r\n  before_filter :authenticate_user!\r\n  def user_params\r\n    params.require(:user).permit :first_name, :last_name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :phone\r\n  end\r\n  private :user_params\r\n  def index\r\n    @response = BrowseUsers.new(@request).call.extend(UserPresenter)\r\n    respond_with @response\r\n  end\r\n  def show\r\n    @response = LoadUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response\r\n  end\r\n  alias_method :edit, :show\r\n  def new\r\n    @response = NewUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response\r\n  end\r\n  def create\r\n    @request.object_attributes = user_params\r\n    @response = SaveUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response.user, location: users_path\r\n  end\r\n  alias_method :update, :create\r\n  def destroy\r\n    @response = DeleteUser.new(@request).call\r\n    respond_with @response, location: users_path\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tUse the generator like so:\r\n\t<code>rails generate controller users index show new create destroy</code>\r\n\tIt will work in much the same way as the controller I posted previously:</p><p>\r\n\tThe generator also adds rendering code that uses tilt-handlebars to render a template that can be shared between back-end and front-end.</p><h3>Decoupling UI from the Use Cases</h3><p>\r\n\tIn keeping with the theme of writing clean, decoupled code, I decided to root out the rendering portions of Rails by calling the Rails app generator with the following options:\r\n\t<code>--skip-action-view --skip-sprockets --skip-javascript</code></p><p>\r\n\tWhat does this mean for developers? The front-end is now completely decoupled from the back-end. Front-end developers are free to use their preferred tools such as Bower and Gulp to manage dependencies and front-end builds. Back-end developers are now free to focus entirely on the API without having to worry about finding up-to-date gems for their front-end framework of choice. Even full-stack developers who handle both front and back-end will benefit from the increased manageability and testability of the decoupled code.</p><h3>What Needs to be Done</h3><p>\r\n\tObviously this is not a complete framework or example for creating Rails apps according to the Clean Architecture pattern, but I hope it can at least spur more discussion and help people get started. I have only worked on one application using this design but there are many things I like about it. Of course there are big areas that could use improvement (such as the problem of making reusable serializers). I hope to work more in this area and provide more and better examples as I gain experience and receive feedback.

Brian Moynihan, head of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Health-20-NC-Triangle-4964713/about\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">Triangle chapter of Health 2.0</a>, had a longstanding interest in hosting this event in North Carolina. \u201cThis was really a dream come true for me,\u201d he said. \u201cEver since coming to my first Startup Weekend last year, I had wanted to put on a health-centered event. It was a great chance for people who have an innovative idea to get feedback from physicians, developers, HIPAA experts, business people and more.\u201d</p><p>But the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://startupweekend.org\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend</a> isn\u2019t a North Carolina phenomenon. Powered by Google for Entrepreneurs, more than 1,500 events have been held around the world. Each location has the prerogative to organize around a topic of its choice, with past topics including healthcare, education, and more. </p><p>Even as the players and topics vary from event to event, the format for the weekend remains highly collaborative and intense: Friday night participants pitch their ideas and self-select to form teams. On Saturday teams are hard at work talking about their concept with help from coaches and experts as they simultaneously work on business plans, branding, and prototypes. Sunday morning everyone is back together bright and early, talking with strangers, friends, and potential users to validate their concept. Finally after a whirlwind of brainstorming and execution, the teams pitch to a panel of investors and experienced entrepreneurs to compete for the glory of having the best idea. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDgvMjEvMTAvMDkvNDgvMjIwL1RTV19UZWFtcGhvdG8uanBnIl1d/TSW_Teamphoto.jpg?sha=51df2f49\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"></p><p>Bobby Bahram, a judge from the Startup weekend and manager at <a href=\"http://www.exceleratehealth.com/\">Excelerate Health Ventures</a>, was inspired by the participants. \u201cSeeing passionate entrepreneurs - most of them strangers prior to Friday - morph into a cohesive team to bring ambitious ideas to life is a testament to the dedication of the weekend warriors and our growing entrepreneurial community,\u201d he said. They are fast-paced, high energy, and inspiring weekends.</p><p>A few of the ideas that formed during the weekend included an app to keep diabetes patients accountable for taking their blood sugar readings, various concepts for telemedicine, and a fresh take on intubation devices. The winning team developed natural feminine hygiene products using coconut oil. </p><p><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDgvMjAvMTcvMDYvMjUvNzg4L0VNX2hlYWRzaG90LmpwZyJdXQ/EM_headshot.jpg?sha=0228e761\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"></p><p>As a coach for the weekend, I had the opportunity to sit down with a participant from the weekend, Emily Mangone, a PhD student at UNC\u2019s School of Public Health, <a href=\"http://www.fhi360.org/\">FHI360 </a>Fellow, and member of the Connect the Docs Startup Weekend team. Here are some insights from our question and answer session:</p><p><strong>Why were you interested in participating in this event?</strong></p><p>I\u2019ve wanted to participate more in the business aspect of innovative mhealth products. My own research has been towards developing an app related to reproductive health. I wanted to learn about all the elements to a winning team. As a student I don\u2019t have a lot of free time and I wanted to see what that process looked like in a compact period of time. </p><p><strong>How did your team merge health with technology? </strong></p><p>Our idea started as combination of health and technology through EMRs to make them compatible across different systems, however we were informed that the government is going to mandate openness across EMR platforms. Our final idea, CareStream, was a tool for the documentation of medical information that can be used to organize information about care from different health systems to get a snapshot of someone\u2019s health history. Our team also illustrates the perfect merge: a few doctors, a physician entrepreneur, an MBA student, myself with a public health background, and a tireless programmer. I learned that I need to have one or two programmers if I want to pitch something in such a high tech field like mHealth. Even just to build a website I\u2019d want that level of support. </p><p><strong>How do you think events such as this one can enhance the health technology sector in the Triangle?</strong></p><p>I think it creates a lot of energy and buzz around innovative ideas. It\u2019s an incubator for talented people who want to work on new problems with other people who have similar interests but different expertise. We want people to have great ideas in the Triangle so we can bring more technology business right to our front door. </p><p><strong>What was your biggest takeaway from the weekend?</strong></p><p>Pitching a product you love is ideal, but what I got out of the weekend was learning about the process- from finding an idea, researching, putting together a team, doing market research, and more. I got a really cool understand of the process to bring a product to market in the field that I am interested in. I wanted to do something out of my comfort zone so I worked with a diverse team--it was high tech, mobile, and complex. There was just a great group of people I could learn from. I was grateful for what I got out of the event. </p><p><strong>What do you see for the future of healthcare and tech?</strong></p><p>I think healthcare is rapidly coming down to individual engagement, whether it is online, from your phone or your own home. Through technology, people can be more involved with their care. I\u2019m hopeful for the future of healthcare and hopeful that technology will reduce costs and improve efficiency. </p><p><em>Interested in future Startup weekends? </em><em>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smashingboxes\" style=\"font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\">Twitter</a></em><em> to hear more about mHealth events and sponsorships.</em></p><p><em>Cover photo by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/36243589@N04/\">Dr. Farouk</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tYou may have heard the terms \u201cGrowth Specialist\u201d or \u201cGrowth Hacker\u201d before but never quite understood what they were. Maybe you thought they were just buzzwords, or you didn\u2019t even realize they played a role in the marketing world. Well, you\u2019re in the right place to find out the mysteries of \u201cgrowth.\u201d We\u2019ll give you insight into the next generation of user advocates, Growth Engineers, and why Growth Engineering (GE) is important for you and your business.</p><h3>The History of Growth Hacking</h3><p>\r\n\tGrowth Engineering stems from Growth Hacking. Growth Hacking combines marketing with technology and is a technique used primarily by startups that don\u2019t have money or experience to implement a big marketing campaign. Ryan Holliday of <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3003888/everything-marketing-how-growth-hackers-redefine-game\" target=\"_blank\">Fast Company</a> said, \u201cBecause [startups] didn't have access to the \"luxuries\" of an ad budget or the burden of proper training, they were able to be creative enough to broaden the definition of marketing to immense advantage.\u201d The term \u201c<a href=\"http://www.startup-marketing.com/where-are-all-the-growth-hackers/\" target=\"_blank\">growth hacker</a>\u201d was first seen in a blog post by Sean Ellis in 2010. He had meant it to be for the scrappy startups who didn\u2019t have the resources for a traditional approach to market their product. He said, \u201cA growth hacker is a person whose true North is growth,\" meaning every action is done to promote growth.</p><h3>Enter Growth Engineering</h3><p>\r\n\tGrowth Engineering builds on the core principle of Growth Hacking: growing the user base! Accruing users is the sole purpose of anything with \u201cgrowth\u201d in front of it. Obviously you can\u2019t increase users without using some more traditional marketing strategies and techniques, like social media, email, and content marketing, but the difference is the end goal and the methods used to achieve that goal. The traditional methods focus on brand awareness and thought leadership, drawing people to the site or app in the first place. Growth Engineering focuses on keeping them there, and turning the casual user into a brand advocate. In the great words of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkTb7Pe2MtY\" target=\"_blank\">Tron</a>, \u201cI fight for the users\u201d - that\u2019s what we growth engineers do.</p><p>\r\n\tBut there is more to Growth Engineering than a more grown up name. This brings us to the second great love of growth engineers: data. A large component of Growth Engineering is testing, data mining, and trend analyzing that gives the holistic view of user\u2019s interactions and leads to user retention. Growth engineers want to measure and increase user conversion at every step of the way to truly understand why and which users convert.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/growth_engineering-3.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5487\" alt=\"growth_engineering (3)\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/growth_engineering-3.png\" width=\"612\" height=\"1340\"></a></p><h3>Who Benefits from Growth Engineering</h3><p>\r\n\tGrowth services are applicable to businesses with a web or mobile product. For example, a company trying to drive traffic to an ecommerce site and then increase conversions would benefit greatly from Growth services. Their Growth team would be able to test sale funnels, set up heat-maps, analyze retention and referrals, and so on.</p><p>\r\n\tOf course, Growth Engineering is not for everyone. For instance, if a product startup is trying to get brand recognition with a guerrilla marketing campaign, as opposed to a digital marketing initiative, Growth Engineering is not for them.</p><h3>Using Growth Engineering to Compound Your Marketing Efforts</h3><p>\r\n\tTo build upon your current marketing efforts, Growth Engineers can also employ Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, and other Search Engine Marketing (SEM) tactics that increase site traffic. The key differentiator between traditional marketing efforts and Growth Engineering is the focus on getting users to stay, convert, and return time after time to use your product. Growth Engineers focus on testable aspects of a site where the data will tell them what is or is not working so they can optimize the user experience.</p><h3>Where Can I Find Growth Engineering Services?</h3><p>\r\n\tWe are excited to announce that Smashing Boxes is now available to assist companies with Growth Engineering. Our team will work with you to develop and implement data-driven, sustainable user growth techniques. Stay tuned to our blog to learn more about the rollout of this new service and how it can impact your bottom line.</p>",

They take a break from normal projects and create something that lets their creative pulses beat a little faster. In fact, you\u2019ve probably heard of some of the projects that have come out of the 20% time. They include Gmail (really!), Google News, AdSense, Google Talk and Google Sky.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAt Smashing Boxes, we\u2019re all about encouraging our team to hone their talents in a personal way, too.

A surfer takes his cues from the environment surrounding him \u2013 wave height, tide, and water and air temperatures are all factors that can make or break a day riding waves. CRNT displays all of this information within a sleek iOS and Android app that helps surfers determine the current conditions of their favorite surf breaks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\"I'm specifically working on the server back-end of the application and also the iOS side of things,\" she said. \"The back-end involved grabbing data from multiple sources and providing it to the application.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tAs a product owner, you have probably questioned how to use the data that you collect from your web analytics tools to grow your business.</p><p>\r\n\tWeb analytics give great insights into how users interact with your site or content, but there are limitations to how much the default settings will tell you about your site. If you want to get higher level insights, you will have to go to your web developer and have them code something for you.</p><p>\r\n\tThis series of articles will give you some ideas on how to make the shift from passively analyzing to actively growing your users. This might be as simple as changing the setup of your analytics account or implementing a few additional tools. Let\u2019s start from the beginning with web analytics.</p><p>\r\n\tThe majority of people and businesses use \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics</a> as their primary web analytics tool. It is a robust, free tool that has quite a lot to offer. After you have it set up on your site you can start collecting data. The data is compiled in different reports as follows:</p><ul>\r\n\t<li>Audience Reports- Reports that specify who is looking at your site and where they are viewing from\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Geography</li>\t\t<li>Device Type </li>\t\t<li>Browser Type</li>\t\t<li>New or Returning</li>\t</ul></li>\t<li>Behavior Reports - Reports that indicate the frequency of views, how long the viewer stays on the page and what they look for\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Behavior Flows</li>\t\t<li>Site Content </li>\t\t<li>Site Speed</li>\t</ul></li>\t<li>Acquisitions Reports - Reports that tell the product owner where site visitors are coming from and what actions they take while on the site\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Channels</li>\t\t<li>All Traffic</li>\t\t<li>All Referrals </li>\t</ul></li>\t<li>Real Time Reports - Reports that allow you to monitor activity <em>as</em> it happens\r\n<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Overview</li>\t\t<li>Locations</li>\t\t<li>Traffic Sources</li>\t\t<li>Content</li>\t\t<li>Events</li>\t\t<li>Conversions</li>\t</ul></li></ul><p>\r\n\tYou can learn a lot from just these settings, but there are more sophisticated options/reports in Google Analytics which will give you greater insights into to your site data. However, these reports will require a more advanced setup to actually gather data you need. For example, if you have an e-commerce site, you will need to collect data that is specific to your purchase funnel. For more complex steps like this you may need to talk to your web developer or an analytics service provider to assist you (we\u2019ll have more on e-commerce later in this series).</p><p>\r\n\tHere are some analytics tips that anyone with admin access to your Google Analytics can tackle that will allow you to better understand your users. Start by performing an audit of your setup to make sure it's correctly implemented. All of these can be performed in the admin portal of your account.</p><p>\r\n\t1. Check that the tracking code is in the head tag of your website. A simple test to check this is to visit the \r\n\t<strong>Real Time</strong> tab in Google Analytics Reporting while you are on the site to see if it shows that you are active on the site.\r\n\t</p><p>\t2. Our recommended Google Analytics account structure is to have an \r\n\t<strong>All Web Site Data </strong>view, a <strong>Filtered </strong>view, and a <strong>Test </strong>view. To create a view, navigate to <strong>Admin</strong> and \u201cCreate new view\u201d under <strong>View</strong>:\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6bBwPnOSY-EOzxdBEm8TutUF1kr4yjXwUYix-e8yYvXyhWAu6edw5Tw1jV6zSFYkV05nyiepaXZUJ93IVMpXyBteM63abta-FsoC_hD5QSa3VuHpy1nOMi0R8Tk592ktvw\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"189px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p>\r\n\tClearly name these views so that their content will be recognizable to anyone looking at your data. For example, \u201cCompany Name Filtered View\u201d. Your newly created views will now be visible in the \r\n\t<strong>View</strong> dropdown:</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hQTXfOCBQazJymiEBB_p9FUuo4At1OQbgusbB0HMCxa8lu0cwI26MG_W9ow0CLT5xWXM69VyARK7NfYeeuEqRer1QzQq6OfB4hZEHh9g1gJcsRZBC3nJ4nPCjjQo3VMtHQ\" width=\"243px;\" height=\"328px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p>\r\n\tNote: If you make a new view you won\u2019t see any data that was collected prior to when you created the view. Don't be alarmed. Unfortunately that is how it works if you didn\u2019t create the views when you first installed Google Analytics.</p><p>\r\n\t3. Filter out your own IP address. You don\u2019t want your sessions skewing your site data, but make sure you \r\n\t<strong>DO NOT</strong> add a filter to your <strong>All Web Site Data</strong> view. This filter should be added to your <strong>Filtered </strong>view or <strong>Test</strong> view. To create a filter, navigate to your <strong>Filtered</strong> view in the <strong>View</strong> drop down:</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GwQ6sfpHe2F_M_zH76-brQpy4NGxC8yAKLST61Qsx4Xgc7D0psnjFA9oeC8XVIHtMfxr4al2xOee94pnGz7nzvyP0lf38XccTmaoAzs2AbeGUOGH3F-JrIrm-DXgRmku7w\" width=\"237px;\" height=\"301px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p>\r\n\tOnce you select your\r\n\t<strong> Filtered </strong>view, navigate to <strong>Filters</strong> and click the \u201c+ New Filter\u201d button:</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BNEIVZxij5A9WZWq3yhk5TIzrjeTIB65BN9SdH87PWGfh1uiV6gt1ctKeEhh2f5-DWWbhdQ7XCAqdKxP3eW7mOarc6D2J0sXBCmLUhKI9BB7okruAZz31EQn7Vhoh_Oh0g\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"195px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p>\r\n\tThis opens the \u201cadd filter\u201d page where you can name your filter and select the filter parameters:</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7_5tMXkPpBrbCvPR5gq_PCbqXGObDfbPRxCTz_KvEqU5oPW5ic0usGbfT4e_9GddpInCM-AQSqstYnCDkl6zLaPD2yQYv06ik1Tl0ij76Hl-VIrAVUALdB5rSVmypbZAag\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"279px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p>\r\n\tFilters do not apply to historical data, but from now on you won\u2019t be tracked on your own site and luckily, you still have your untouched \r\n\t<strong>All Website Data</strong> view. Best practice is to first add the filter to your <strong>Test</strong> view to check if it is filtering your data as expected. If so, then you can add the filter to your <strong>Filtered </strong>view.</p><p>\r\n\t4. If you have a search bar on your site, make sure you are tracking what people are searching for. This is NOT Keyword tracking, which Google has reduced the usability of with most showing up as (not provided). However if your site has a search bar on it, you can see what terms users are searching for. This gives you insights into what your users are coming to your site for and what they expect to find on your site, which can aid in what you should use in your content to improve SEO.</p><p>\r\n\tTo set up\r\n\t<strong> Site Search Tracking</strong>, we recommend navigating to <strong>View Settings </strong>in your <strong>Test</strong> view. Scroll down to find \u201cSite Search Settings\u201d and switch \u201con\u201d site search tracking. In the<strong> Query Parameter</strong> field, you must enter the word or character that defines the internal search term. For example, <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/tips-for-passing-the-2014-google-analytics-exam%20\">smashingboxes.com/?s=pass+google+analytics+exam</a>, the query parameter is the \u201cs\u201d.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l53Q5mbYrxaPFQIHS8HIlZeixZdJh23c_6ssYetNQ7KebYMf2fN3eJqexMEWo1jOxLwzAAMPwO_S-5X_kubEhuQfbIXK43bmoyyNkBEplky-fjyZjUoPc9-W7PYrg1Gi9g\" width=\"320px;\" height=\"310px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p>\r\n\tClick save and remember that this only turns on site search tracking for the selected view. Once you check that it is working for the \r\n\t<strong>Test</strong> view, feel free to add it to any view.</p><p>\r\n\tThese are simple implementations that will give you more accurate user data and information on how users navigate through your site. Growth Engineering focuses on growing and retaining users and these are great configurations to get you started.</p><p>Next up, check out <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/button-tracking-using-google-tag-manager\">this tutorial</a> on button tracking using Google Tag Manager. </p>",

        "body": "<h3 id=\"sec-1-1\">What is TDD?</h3><p>\r\n  At its core, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a very simple idea: write a test before writing a new feature. Although Kent Beck is often credited with the discovery of TDD, he himself \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Test-Driven-Development/Why-does-Kent-Beck-refer-to-the-rediscovery-of-test-driven-development\">says he found it described in an ancient book about programming on tape</a>. The book described manually typing the expected output on one tape and then programming until the actual output matches the expected output. The principle may have been around earlier but Kent Beck is responsible for popularizing it through his 2002 book, <em>Test-Driven Development: By Example</em>.</p><p>\r\nThis \"test-first\" concept is in opposition to our natural instinct to start writing code as soon as we come up with an implementation in our head, however na\u00efve it may be. But what some developers don't realize is that by writing code without tests, they are relying on a poor man's TDD. The developer writes a tentative method, then starts a debugger and manually triggers the method with ad hoc data. As soon as it seems to be working, he moves on to other code. Periodically the developer runs the entire application and performs a few sanity checks just to be sure everything works together. Finally, the code is deployed and the inevitable bug reports stream in. Bugs are patched quickly, often uncovering new bugs which are sometimes caught before they go live on production. Assuming the application doesn't require constant addition of new features, the app continues running and the frequency of bug reports gradually lessens until finally an equilibrium is reached in which all bugs are either fixed or are well-enough understood to be considered \"quirks\" or even \"features\".</p><p>\r\nTDD encourages developers to admit that each line of code needs testing. Rather than testing in an ad hoc way, a test framework should be used in order to explicitly define tests. And if we're going to write tests for our code, why not write the test first so that we have something with which to check our work? TDD is the logical conclusion of the premise that tests help us write better code.</p><p>\r\nWriting a test in the Test Driven Development style is similar to the old practice of typing expected output on tape. If we know our inputs we should have an expectation about what the exact output of our code will be. We can't test every possible value for each input, but we can at least test an expected range of values. Code should be written in such a way as to handle values that are outside of expected ranges. Tests can be either positive, affirming something works, or negative, ensuring that bad data raise exceptions.</p><p>\r\nLet's look at the simplest example. How can we use TDD to write an addition function?</p><h4 id=\"sec-1-1-1\">Set up</h4><p>\r\nFirst we write an empty test and an empty class in order to get things running.</p><p>\r\n\t<code>addition1_spec.rb</code></p><pre class=\"src src-ruby\">require 'rspec/core'\r\nrequire './addition1'\r\ndescribe Addition do\r\n  it \"adds two numbers\" do\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\t<code>additional1.rb</code></p><pre class=\"src src-ruby\">class Addition\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\nNow run the test:</p><pre class=\"src src-sh\">rspec ./addition1_spec.rb\r\n</pre><p>\r\nAnd we get:</p><pre class=\"example\">.\r\nFinished in 0.00024 seconds (files took 0.09515 seconds to load)\r\n1 example, 0 failures\r\n</pre><p>\r\nThis step is to make sure we don't have any problems with our testing environment. We can now proceed to the actual test writing.</p><h4 id=\"sec-1-1-2\">Test first</h4><p>\r\nNow we'll add a failing test. This is the \"Red\" part of the \"Red, Green, Refactor\" test cycle.</p><p>\r\n\t<code>addition2_spec.rb</code></p><pre class=\"src src-ruby\">require 'rspec/core'\r\nrequire './addition2'\r\ndescribe Addition do\r\n  it \"adds two numbers\" do\r\n    result = subject.add(2, 2)\r\n    expect(result).to eq(4)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\t<code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">subject</code> is a new instance of <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">Addition</code>. When we call <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">add</code> on <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">subject</code> with the arguments <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">2, 2</code> we expect the result to equal <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">4</code>. <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">eq</code> is Rspec's equivalent to the == operator.</p><p>\r\n\t<code>addition2.rb</code></p><pre class=\"src src-ruby\">class Addition\r\n  def add(x, y)\r\n end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\nWe write the empty \r\n\t<code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">add</code> method so that our test can run without throwing an exception. The test case will fail because <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">result</code> doesn't equal <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">4</code>, not because of a <code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">NoMethodError</code>.</p><p>\r\nAnd run the test:</p><pre class=\"src src-sh\">rspec ./addition2_spec.rb\r\n</pre><pre class=\"example\">F\r\nFailures:\r\n  1) Addition adds two numbers\r\n     Failure/Error: expect(result).to eq(4)\r\n       expected: 4\r\n            got: nil\r\n       (compared using ==)\r\n     # ./addition2_spec.rb:8:in `block (2 levels) in &lt;top (required)&gt;'\r\nFinished in 0.00074 seconds (files took 0.36751 seconds to load)\r\n1 example, 1 failure\r\nFailed examples:\r\nrspec ./addition2_spec.rb:6 # Addition adds two numbers\r\n</pre><p>\r\nAs expected, our test fails because we didn't actually implement the \r\n\t<code style=\"display:inline;background:white;color:#444;\">Addtion#add</code> method.</p><h4 id=\"sec-1-1-3\">Implement the method</h4><p>\r\nNow write just enough code to pass the test.</p><p>\r\n\t<code>addition3.rb</code></p><pre class=\"src src-ruby\">class Addition\r\n  def add(x, y)\r\n    x + y\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n</pre><p>\r\nAnd run the test:</p><pre class=\"src src-sh\">rspec ./addition3_spec.rb\r\n</pre><pre class=\"example\">.\r\nFinished in 0.00035 seconds (files took 0.06439 seconds to load)\r\n1 example, 0 failures\r\n</pre><p>\r\nOur test passes. Now we'd go on to refactoring if this were a more realistic example. For each change we make we re-run our test and ensure that everything is still working as expected.</p><p>\r\nThis is the simplest example of what TDD looks like. In a future blog post we'll look at more realistic examples.</p><h3 id=\"sec-1-2\">What's the controversy over?</h3><p>\r\n  So if TDD can help us write better code, why would some developers oppose it? </p><p>Recently a debate began over a keynote and \r\n\t<a href=\"http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html\">blog post</a> by David Heinemeier Hansson, original author of Ruby on Rails. His main concern with TDD centers around the possibility of design damage due to a dogmatic test-drivenness that insists on keeping tests fast at all costs, extensive mocking,  and 100% coverage at the unit level. Kent Beck and Martin Fowler, both proponents of TDD, <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/\">held a series of conversations</a> with David in which they each described the benefits and shortcomings of TDD and attempted to clear up some misconceptions about the terminology and best practices associated with TDD. </p><p>As influential as each of them are, their opinions will continue to influence developers as they face the same trade-offs. The debate will continue at least until we come up with better practices, but many fundamental things will stay the same. All engineering involves trade-offs, so there will never be a silver bullet that solves all problems. We shouldn't neglect the collected wisdom of those who have gone before us. If we do neglect their experiences, we will inevitably repeat their mistakes and make their discoveries vain as we struggle to re-discover on our own. </p><p>In future blog posts, I will look more at the evidence that TDD works, look at some practical examples, and explore alternatives to TDD.<br></p><p><em>Check out TDD for beginners <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/beginners-guide-to-test-driven-development-tdd\">here</a>.</em></p>",

The workspace area will only adjust vertically and horizontally as you move your elements around the canvas. I\u2019m coming from an <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks.html\">Adobe</a> background where I\u2019m easily able to zoom out or pan around and actually have some space between my design and the edge of the viewport.

Just add a small element to the page and drag it far down to the bottom right, farther than you feel you\u2019ll need space for your mockup. The Magical Extra Element allows you to scroll both horizontally and vertically past your mockup, granting a little breathing room between the mockup and the edges of the canvas.

Having dedicated my career to both the creative and healthcare industries, I\u2019m well aware of the problem.</p><p>In my Master\u2019s of Public Health program&nbsp;I worked with statistical software, tore apart published research, and learned to speak in acronym alphabet soup. However, I didn\u2019t learn what goes into building web and mobile applications, nor the tools necessary for it like Photoshop&nbsp;or UXPin. And this is okay. We are not supposed to know those things. But we should be savvy enough to hire people who do. </p><p>As the Digital Health Strategist for a design and web development agency,&nbsp;I\u2019ve seen first hand the impact that user research, experience design, and technical innovation can have for health organizations. The result of integrating these best practices is a website or product that your users will reach for. Here are a few tips for attacking this design challenge: </p><ul> \r\n<li><strong>Ke</strong><strong>ep it simple, but significant.</strong> Chances are your audience is comprised of patients, the general public, or people with health-related questions. They may not know the inside jargon and 10-syllable words that are the norm in our industry. Talk to your audience simply, remembering that you\u2019ll get your message across best if it is easy to understand.</li></ul><ul> \r\n<li><strong>Cut through the noise. </strong>There is a global hunger for accessible health information, ranging from finding the right specialist at a hospital, to appointment scheduling, to understanding personal health records. How do you cut through the noise? With well-executed design, relevant content, and paying attention to your audience\u2019s needs. Your design speaks volumes about your credibility and relevance as an organization.  </li></ul><ul> \r\n<li><strong>Consult with digital design experts.</strong> They can provide insight about intuitive navigation and how to organize an information-heavy site or application. Use those conversations to find the right digital partner to bring your website or mobile app to life. </li></ul><ul> \r\n<li><strong>Design for people.</strong> Address your audience\u2019s needs at each stage of the design and development process and turn the focus toward the \u201chuman\u201d in human-centered design. See how we helped Duke, the CDC, and the deBeaumont Foundation do that with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/work/duke\" target=\"_blank\">Practical Playbook</a>.</li></ul><p>So let's use our favorite word - innovate - and change our industry's approach to web and mobile design. User-friendliness coupled with smart, simple design are key to creating a real impact on our target populations. It's time to disrupt the status quo and start making websites&nbsp;and apps people will actually want to use.&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Check out our latest design work and experimentation on </em><a href=\"http://dribbble.com/smashingboxes\" style=\"font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\">Dribbble</a><em style=\"background-color: initial;\">.</em></p><p><em>About the author:&nbsp;Katie Donohue McMillan, MPH is the Digital Health Technology Strategist at Smashing Boxes as well as a founding member of the Triangle mHealth Consortium.

What about Detroit? Paris? Cities carry with them feelings about people and businesses, visions of landmarks, or a subtle taste of a certain kind of food. There\u2019s even a legitimate communications theory based on this idea. <a href=\"http://masscommtheory.com/theory-overviews/framing-theory/\">The Framing Theory</a> suggests that people have certain perceptions about places based on what they\u2019ve heard or seen from media, not from actual experience. Enveloping all of these perceptions and emotions is a city\u2019s brand. And for anyone who lives outside of that city, the brand can have a significant impact on the way they feel about it, whether they would visit, do business, or even move there.</p><p>But branding goes deeper than an image. With the world as globalized and networked as it is, every city has to compete for tourists, investment, capital, business, attention, and even respect. How cities communicate their soul and success is crucial for deciding which ones succeed and which ones fail in the rivalry for economic prosperity. In this sense, cities are like companies. Those with a strong and powerful brand have an easier time selling their products and services that are attractive to people and investors. As the city of Raleigh expands and looks to enhance its domestic image, the idea of branding plays a key role in its reputation and perception.</p><p>With the recent \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wral.com/raleigh-has-a-new-long-term-vision-in-mind-for-downtown/13978245/\">Downtown Experience Plan</a>\u201d put into action to reinvent certain parts of downtown Raleigh, I wanted to revisit some prior work done by our own designer, Raleigh Felton, for the exact purpose of rebranding and drawing attraction to a city. Earlier this year, creative agency <a href=\"http://www.baldwinand.com/\">Baldwin&amp;</a> masterminded the <a href=\"http://instagram.com/rebrandraleigh\">Rebrand Raleigh Instagram account</a> in an effort to create a fresh brand for the City of Oaks. The account is owned by each designer for two weeks, in which they rediscover what Raleigh means to them through the medium of art and illustration. After two weeks, the account is passed to the next audacious designer. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>This is the story of Felton\u2019s journey in designing a brand for the city of Raleigh and what it means for all cities seeking out a brand strong enough to carry them into the future:</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspiration&nbsp;and Discovery</h3><h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The juxtaposition of old and new leaves a striking impression on those visiting Raleigh for the first time. There\u2019s no doubt it is still a city in transition. Aged, brick buildings along the main street sit in the shadows of glass towers. A rustic-chic coffee shop serving brunch to a fashionable crowd looks out to a grimy, dark bus station. There is both a blending of cultures and eras; and a separation.</span></p></h3><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/myFAygCYO7/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5044\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY1-iamraleigh.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><p>Felton began by exploring this separation through design, melding the old and historic with the new and energetic. A city\u2019s brand must be a reflection of the energy, diversity, and individualism of people that give a city it\u2019s unique vibe. The individuality of each person is what makes a city like Raleigh so great.&nbsp;</p><h3>Gaining Perspective</h3><h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Inspiration comes from observing a subject from various angles and perspectives. The art and the textures of cities are startling when you begin to see out the details. In Raleigh, Felton discovered a blending and balance of dissimilar surfaces, textures, and the interlacing of old and new.</span></p></h3><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m0uNh4CYPI/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5045\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY2-intial_thoughts.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m3Wdc7CYD1/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5048\" title=\"Raleigh, North Carolina Photography Rebrand Raleigh\" alt=\"Raleigh, North Carolina Photography Rebrand Raleigh\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY3.1-photos.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></strong><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><h3>\r\nDesign Elements\r\n</h3><p>Color, patterns, angles, shapes: Each must be carefully selected to reflect the movement and emotion of a city. Together they craft that elusive \u2018contemporary symbol\u2019. Is there a pattern that can speak a city in its entirety? Different angles, shapes, and colors represent the individuality of people, businesses, cultures, ideas, and areas. In Raleigh, they all come together to make the city we love.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m8ePznCYDD/\"><img class=\" wp-image-5051 aligncenter\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Logo Exploration\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY6-exploration1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></a></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m5YPl1CYLD/\"><img class=\"wp-image-5050 aligncenter\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Color Exploration \" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY4.1-color.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m742AfCYAF/\"><img class=\"wp-image-5047 aligncenter\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Pattern Exploration\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Competition Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY5-pattern.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;\"></a></p><h3>\r\nReal-world Application\r\n</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><p>Inevitably, these metaphors and impressions must translate to a brand that will function in real life. Great designers know that everything should be crafted with purpose. A logo can have beautiful form and extract feeling from its viewer, yet it still has to fit into context and serve its underlying purpose. Here, Felton applies his designs to various city commodities and institutions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/rebrandraleigh\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5054\" alt=\"DAY8-aplications\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY8-aplications.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width:600px;\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/nL2HpWiYBa/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5059\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY13-all.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/nLei2SCYOV/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5058\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY12-image.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></p><h3>What Brands Mean for Cities</h3><h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">A strong brand encompass the meaning of an idea or purpose of an institution, and expresses it to all that view its simple, solitary image. By nature, logos and designs are an evolution. As the institution or idea they represent changes over time, so must they. And as the city of Raleigh continues to shift and grow with each new face, business, and idea, so will the logos, designs, and words that attempt to capture it. The same can be applied to every city. The brand of a place reflects the soul of its inhabitants.</span></p><p>View more of Raleigh Felton\u2019s branding and design work <a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/work\">here</a>.</p></h3><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/nD6Eq-CYAP/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5042\" title=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Logo System\" alt=\"Rebrand Raleigh Instagram Raleigh Felton Designer\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DAY7.1-Logo-System.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></a></p>",

Available only on Windows and Chrome OS for the time being, the Chrome App launcher marks another step along Google\u2019s path to convergence for its software platform, but more than that it marks a shift in the way we think about applications.</p><p>\r\n\tChrome Apps (still just called Chrome Apps for now) are security-sandboxed applications built with HTML, CSS and Javascript that have access to some system hardware, such as the GPU and connected devices, as well as the Chrome APIs already used by their Web counterparts. Gaining access to the desktop means Chrome Apps can perform offline functionality without having to rely on Local Storage and the size limitations that come with it, or on the more fully-featured but \r\n\t<a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag\">significantly more complex Application Cache</a>. Utilizing the same technologies used to build Web apps today means Web developers just gained a new platform they can deploy to.</p><p>\r\n\tThe average end user doesn\u2019t care what their app is built with as long as it loads quickly and does what it\u2019s told. Web technologies have been mature enough to create attractive, responsive interfaces for some time now, but a browser is still needed in most cases to render the code. Chrome Apps have none of the standard Chrome browser controls, so visually they can look like anything. Even native desktop apps are typically governed to some extend by the design of the parent OS.</p><p>\r\n\tThe challenge and opportunity exists in taking advantage of this paradigm shift in app definition. The Web can\u2019t do everything, but it\u2019s well on it\u2019s way. Data-centric apps are prime targets and well-suited to the Chrome platform. Every successful app that runs in the browser &mdash; think Mint, Soundcloud, Facebook, Hulu, not to mention Google Apps as a whole &mdash; are all prime examples of what is possible with the browser. Without an address bar and a back button all of these apps would be indistinguishable from something out of the Mac App Store.</p><p>\r\n\tApplications like Adobe Photoshop, FinalCut Pro, and Maya are a ways away from becoming Chrome Apps. Resource heavy, media-centric applications benefit from performance gains of native code and direct access to hardware &mdash; two things most browser apps can\u2019t make use of&hellip; yet. As more of the barriers between Web and desktop are broken down and Web apps get better access to hardware, Web counterparts to these high-powered media apps will likely be more commonplace.</p><p>\r\n\tChrome Apps have always felt kind of like glorified browser extensions, even with a shiny marketplace and the ability to sync when you sign into Chrome. There are definitely good Chrome Apps available, but even some of those are just the app website wrapped in a container.</p><p>\r\n\tMoving to make them \u201cfirst-class citizens\u201d &mdash; something that will sound familiar to those following the development of \r\n\t<a href=\"http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/tutorials/html5/\">Ubuntu Phone</a> &mdash; is an important step in moving the Web forward as an application platform. Even Windows now has provisions for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211385.aspx\">developing with HTML and Javascript</a>, to say nothing of more web-centric operating systems like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS\">Firefox OS</a> and Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/webapps.html\">Fire platform</a>. It\u2019s clear from current trends that the days of installing to the desktop are nearly at an end.</p><p>\r\n\tWhether Chrome Apps usher in this new era of hardware-accessing, HTML-based applications single-handedly remains to be seen, but anyone creating desktop-only software without an eye on the Web is poised to be left behind by their users.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

But if you aren\u2019t tracking Micro conversions, you could miss out on some great data and may not be be able to fully understand your goal paths.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Category&nbsp;(required):&nbsp;</strong>The name you supply for the group of objects you want to track</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Action&nbsp;(required):&nbsp;</strong>Paired with a category, used to define the user interaction taken</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Label&nbsp;(required): </strong>Gives more detail to the action</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Value: (optional): </strong>Associates a value with the event (ex. monetary) </li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Non-Interaction (optional):</strong> Indicates that the event hit will not be used in bounce&nbsp;rate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA developer will have to connect the event with the asset that you would like to track:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<code>&lt;a href=\"#\" id=\u201cProduct1\u201d onClick=\" ga(\u2018send', \u2018event\u2019, 'category\u2019, \u2019action\u2019, \u2018label\u2019, value);\"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;</code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere\u2019s a simple example. Let\u2019s say that you would like to track how many times a product PDF is downloaded through a button click. We would have to write a similar line of code to the one above that will give us the information we want in our GA account:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Category&nbsp;(required):</strong>&nbsp;PDF_Downloads</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Action&nbsp;(required): </strong>Click_Download</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Label&nbsp;(required): </strong>Product1_PDF</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>V</strong><strong>alue: (optional):</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<code>&lt;a href=\"#\" id=\u201cProduct1\u201d onClick=\" ga(\u2018send', \u2018event\u2019, 'PDF_Downloads\u2019, \u2019Click_Download\u2019, \u2018Product1_PDF\u2019);\"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;</code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow we will be able to see this data and we can answer questions like, \u201chow many times are our PDFs downloaded?\u201d or \u201cWhy do we need to spend time creating downloads?\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven though event tracking is great, you may be realizing that this is not the quickest way to implement event tracking on your site. It can also be tedious and time-consuming for a developer to have to place pieces of code throughout the site, especially if you have multiple PDFs all with different titles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGoogle also recognized this pain point and created a great tool called Google Tag Manager (GTM) that allows you to quickly and easily implement events for your site. Tag Manager acts as a bridge for site owners to tag important events on their site without help from a developer.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe way GTM has made life easier is that you only have to load a code snippet once. This snippet is called the container. The container needs to be placed in&nbsp;immediately after the opening &lt;body&gt; tag.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEx. of a GTM container:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<code>&lt;!-- Google Tag Manager --&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXX\"\r\n\r\n\theight=\"0\" width=\"0\" style=\"display:none;visibility:hidden\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;script&gt;(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':\r\n\r\n\tnew Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\r\n\r\n\tj=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&amp;l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=\r\n\r\n\t'//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\r\n\r\n\t})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;!-- End Google Tag Manager --&gt;\r\n\r\n\t</code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tOnce the container is loaded on your site you will never have to hardcode for an event again! Setting up an event in GTM is similar to the \u201cold way\u201d of event tracking. You still need to identify a category, action, label, value, and non-interaction. You can see in the image below that the same identifiers are used as the example before, but there is something different in the label text box.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NdN2_gBJKX5Tix5kLlDhiS9Pjw0BSVXyrj8dl3fxQqmiwwvTm8xgkvWycKdzTLK9k4rdapS7S2d5OcqHY0KRN_kpYMwzXIcIlZgi8sC4yckweQ7tm7raxbeL4aPaNdYGvg\" width=\"556px;\" height=\"520px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is in the text box is called a macro. This macro will return the id attribute of the element that was clicked. Going back to the example above it will return \u201cProduct1\u201d. This makes tagging easier because this one tag will work for every PDF on your site that has an id; just make sure your developer gives each a clear and unique id. You do not have to create a tag for individual PDFs on your site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can learn even more about your website and its users by becoming versed in Google Analytics and taking the&nbsp;\r\n\t<a href=\"http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/tips-for-passing-the-2014-google-analytics-exam\" target=\"_blank\">GAIQ Exam</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t*With \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ross-ozburn/35/654/63a\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Ozburn</a>\r\n</p>",

Much like what manufacturing and retail experienced when data flow was systematized for operational efficiency, the health care industry is now experiencing: the development, propagation and consumerization of a data logistics system.</p><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ic.gatech.edu/people/mark-braunstein\">Dr. Mark Braunstein</a>, a physician who also heads up the Health Systems Institute at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, works with nearly every aspect of the medical industry to help develop a sensible and efficient approach to information management in medical industries. We interviewed the good doctor to help educate us about what\u2019s current in the world of Healthcare IT. What we learned was so thought provoking that we thought we\u2019d share it here. Over the next few weeks, we will submit for you a series of blogs about this bourgeoning industry in hopes that you, too, find the information inspiring.</p><h3>\r\n\tThe Factors Impacting Health Informatics\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tCall it what you will \u2013 Electronic Health Records, Healthcare IT, Digital Health \u2013 digitizing patient records, caregiver operations and pharma/device manufacturer information is having enormous impact on consumers, healthcare providers, payers and even entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Health information for every American will soon be stored in the cloud, for access by any physician to whom the patient\u2019s permission is given. And that data is further expanding the processes being developed not only for payer/provider, but for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries at large. Our conversations with Dr. Braunstein highlighted three major factors driving and impacting the world of healthcare informatics: Big Data; Finance/the Affordable Care Act; Entrepreneurship.</p><p>\r\n\tWe will explore these topics in future blog posts. But first, we asked Dr. Braunstein for an overview of the environment in which health care is operating. He shared the following insights into the State of Healthcare:</p><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>\r\n\t<strong>Chronic diseases impact care and cost</strong>: between 70% and 95% of health care costs are directly related to treating chronic diseases. Many of these are on the rise, such as diabetes, heart conditions and cancer among them. In fact, a surprising number of people battling chronic diseases are battling multiple chronic diseases.</li></ul><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>\r\n\t<strong>Too few primary care physicians: </strong>In the United States, only 12% of doctors are primary care physicians. This seems almost absurd to those in foreign countries. Compare it to France, for example, where the vast majority of doctors are primary care, healthcare costs are half of that of the US, and life expectancy is significantly longer as well.</li></ul><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<ul>\r\n\t\t\r\n<li>Americans see a complicated network of specialists for treatment&hellip; quite often, up to 14 different doctors each year. Patient data must be shared among each of these care givers in order for appropriate diagnosis and treatments to be given.</li>\t</ul></ul><ul>\r\n\t\r\n<li>\r\n\t<strong>Doctors are moving to EMR, but slowly</strong>: Only about 50% of private physicians have made the move to fully compliant electronic medical records, and approximately 75% of hospitals are \u2018there.\u2019 But they\u2019re beginning to move more quickly now as they will very soon be left out of the network entirely if they are not in compliance.</li></ul><p>\r\n\tThese factors, along with those we will address in future blog posts, actually spell out significant opportunity for creative businesses.

I think being a designer and loving problem solving is just part of your job. As a developer it\u2019s the same thing.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>You had a partner on this book, Mark Lavin. Tell me a little bit about how that came about.</strong></p><p>\r\n\tMark and I actually worked at Caktus Consulting Group for a few years and we just really enjoy working together and work well together. So we decided to write a book.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Why specifically Django?</strong></p><p>\r\n\tI\u2019ve been doing Django since about 2008&hellip;I fell in love with the framework and Python and the whole community in general. It\u2019s a great community to be involved with. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing for awhile now and this book is really about de-mystifying Django. It\u2019s just a lot of fun to be able to do that.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>Right now your book is on early release, \u201craw and unedited,\u201d&nbsp; what exactly does that mean, what\u2019s the thought behind that and when can we expect the final product? </strong></p><p>\r\n\tThe early release is really meant to get a backing&hellip;it\u2019s really just to create some buzz and get people excited about this awesome new thing that is going to be part of the Django community and Python community and also Javascript as well. The book really brings in this sort of client side, back end infrastructure, how those two meet, how they work together.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>So tell us a little bit about what audience this book is designed for and what you hope they take away from it?</strong></p><p>\r\n\tThe audience is really for people who don\u2019t have a lot of experience bringing in client-side and back-end work into a Django environment. It\u2019s definitely not a beginner book.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>So you started off as a designer and programmer, you still are, what was the biggest challenge in transforming form that to author?</strong></p><p>\r\n\tA decision. I\u2019m a person who likes challenges and I don\u2019t understand the concept of boredom so really it was like what\u2019s the next challenge for me and my career?</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>What kind of advice would you give to other programmers who might follow down the same path of authorship?</strong></p><p>\r\n\tFind something that you love. Maybe something that you want to learn a little more about&hellip;Also find a really good editor.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>So after completion of the e-book, is this book going to be available in print? </strong></p><p>\r\n\tYes, it will be available later on this year.</p><p>\r\n\t<strong>You are a clear example of a woman who\u2019s been very successful in tech. What kind of advice would you have for other women who want to follow down the path of programming? </strong></p><p>\r\n\tDon\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t quit, if it\u2019s something you love.

This means that although there are currently around <a href=\"http://www.smartphonehc.com/2013/10/01/17k-mobile-health-wellness-and-fitness-apps/\">17,000 mobile health apps</a> on the market, the door of opportunity for new apps is still wide open to create new solutions for improving health and wellness. So, once you come up with an mHealth app idea, how do you differentiate your app and ensure that health care professionals and/or consumers will actually use yours when the landscape is so crowded?</p><h5><strong>Does your app solve a legitimate health problem?</strong></h5><p>\r\nThe most important driver for an mHealth app should be that it solves a valid pain point in healthcare. There are many areas of health that still need solutions and mHealth has the potential to solve many existing and emerging issues help people save on healthcare expenditures.</p><h5><strong>Is your app easy to use?</strong></h5><p>\r\nDoctors and consumers are busy with their jobs and everyday lives, so they are unlikely to use anything that requires too much extra effort. When designing an app, you want to maximize the value it provides for everyone who is using it, whether the app is saving time for doctors who are interacting with patients through a messaging platform or facilitating access to health information for patients on the go.</p><h5><strong>Does a solution already exist? If so, what makes your solution better?</strong></h5><p>\r\nThe mHealth market is competitive, so it is important to do research ahead of time to ensure that your time isn\u2019t being wasted developing something that is already on the market and has a large following. Differentiate yourself by talking to health care professionals and consumers before and while building your app so that you know you are building something that serves a purpose.</p><h5><strong>Does your app empower patients?</strong></h5><p>\r\nPatient empowerment is key to changing and improving long-term patient behavior, especially for medication adherence and other preventative health measures. If your app enables people to take control of their health outcomes and facilitates healthy behavior, healthcare professionals are more likely to see the benefits of the app and prescribe it to their patients.</p><h5><strong>Will your app require FDA approval?</strong></h5><p>\r\nRecently, the FDA published guidelines outlining the types of apps that they will be regulating. When developing your app, ensure that you know if your app will be considered a medical device or medical device accessory and will be regulated by the FDA. Take a look at our post detailing the recent \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.smashingboxes.com/fda-regulations-on-mhealth/\">FDA regulations around mHealth applications</a> and if your app will be impacted.</p><p>\r\n\tNow that you know what aspects make an mHealth app effective, think about what areas of health where mHealth apps would improve health outcomes.&nbsp;One of the areas where mHealth could make a big impact is medication non-adherence.

I am going to briefly go into a new tool for iOS developers called UIKit Dynamics.</p><p>UIKit Dynamics is a full physics engine integrated into UIKit. Using UIKit Dynamics allows developers to create user interfaces that feel real. This means that UI objects can be considered physical objects that respond to gestures, touches, and changes to orientation. Developers may add behaviors such as gravity, attachments, and forces.</p><p>Want to see this in action? Go ahead and pull out your iPhone (sorry Android users!). On the lock screen there is a camera icon in the bottom right to allow you to quickly navigate to your camera app. Tap and hold on the icon and drag the screen almost half way up \u2013 now let go and watch what happens. Did you see the bounce effect at the bottom of the screen? Try again, but this time only drag the view up so you can just see the take picture button. You will notice there was even less bounce. Now the fun part. Do the same thing, but instead of just letting it go, swipe your finger toward the bottom of the screen like you\u2019re throwing the view down. You will noticeably see a larger bounce from the view depending how fast you swiped the view and if you swipe it fast enough, it will bounce all the way up and launch the camera app!</p><p>In this example I will add a 100\u00d7100 square (green) at the top of my view. I will then add a barrier bar (yellow) about half way down the view. The square will drop from the top (gravity) and bounce off the bar (collision) and then bounce to the bottom of the view.</p><p>Using just these lines of code to add gravity, collision, and item behavior:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4319\" alt=\"UIKit Dynamics: Gravity, Collision, Item Behavior\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image1.png\" width=\"867\" height=\"401\"></a></p><p>Produces the output of the following:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4320\" alt=\"UIKit Dynamics Code Output\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jordan-image2.png\" width=\"434\" height=\"704\"></a></p><p>As you can see the square drops from the top of the view and settles at the bottom. The gray squares show the path of the green square and how it reacted to gravity and collision.</p><p>That is all, I hope you enjoyed learning something new that iOS 7 has to offer!

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tApplication designs typically require users to take at least one action after choosing at least one option. Behind each option is at least one rule determining what happens once an action is triggered. Interaction rules are the most fundamental part of an interaction design, affecting everything from the level of user control, to timing and event order, feedback, what happens at the end of an interaction, and more (check out Dan Saffer\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://microinteractions.com/\">Microinteractions</a> book, for more on rules and interaction structure). There are many factors affecting the usage speed of an application, we will primarily be examining interaction rules in an attempt to demonstrate how their effective design can help make applications easier and faster to use. In short, elimination of options, and their corresponding rules, leads to faster usage speed. Once the design has reached the maximum level of simplicity, there are still many ways to increase usage speed, including creative design based on user research, and elimination of usage error potential.</p><p>\r\n\tApplication rule sets can be simple or quite extensive. As an example, let\u2019s look at some possible rules for a photo sharing application. The rule set for such an application might contain the following:</p><ol>\r\n\t<li>If the user is on a photo album page and \u201cEdit album\u201d is selected, display an editable album title field and a list of photographs.</li>\t<li>If at least one photo is selected, display \u201cDelete selected\u201d and \u201cMove selected\u201d buttons.</li></ol><p>\r\n\tIn the above example, the \u201cDelete selected\u201d and \u201cMove selected\u201d buttons appear only when at least one image has been selected. Irrelevant options remain hidden until the user makes them relevant. It\u2019s in this manner that effective rule design can increase usability by limiting user options. Generally speaking, the fewer the options, the fewer the rules, and the faster the usage speed.</p><p>\r\n\tThe challenge of rule design is knowing your user group well enough to hide or eliminate certain options in a way that feels useful and non-restrictive. Hiding options and revealing them when the time is right, through progressive disclosure, is generally more effective than removing options and content (Check out Jacob Nielsen\u2019s book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/books/mobile-usability/\">Mobile Usability</a>, p. 60 for more on progressive disclosure). This technique can be quite effective if proper trigger affordances are built in to the design so users know how to find hidden content.</p><p>\r\n\tAlthough simplification through elimination of options does wonders for speed of use, there is a point at which further simplification would negatively impact usability. &nbsp;At this point, the challenge becomes knowing how to work with the necessary complexities. &nbsp;Larry Tesler, inventor of the cut-and-paste interaction, constructed a law to address the limitations of simplification. According to Tesler\u2019s Law, all activities have inherent complexity, so there is a point at which simplification is no longer an option (Saffer,&nbsp;<em>Microinteractions</em>, p. 67). Accepting such limitations can be challenging, but there is often still ample room for creativity within such constraints.</p><p>\r\n\tIf user research and testing has been conducted, there are probably many ways to further a design, even under tight constraints and with only basic knowledge of user requirements. As a simple example, let\u2019s look at designing a time picker for an event planning company. With just a small amount of user information, like the fact that users will only create events on or thirty minutes past the hour, we can already begin making more effective decisions. Out of the box most time pickers provide a drop-down list of all hours, and a separate drop-down menu list of all minutes to choose from. If we provide two long lists fill with mostly useless options, the time selection interaction will surely come up short. With basic knowledge of event times, long hour and minutes lists can be combined into one simple list of times in 30-minute increments. A meeting will never be scheduled for&nbsp;10:03pm, so there is no need to include&nbsp;10:03 as a selection choice.</p><p>\r\n\tAfter user research, one way to potentially improve interactions is through error prevention. If users of an application easily make mistakes, the design has great potential for improvement through error prevention design. The goal with many designs is to make it impossible for users to do something wrong. However, it is possible to achieve zero or low usage error potential with varying degrees of success. There are different ways to reduce or eliminate usage error potential, but the best approaches take usage flow into consideration. If an application has hundreds of pop-ups, users may never be able to make a mistake, but it will probably feel like hundreds of mistakes have been made-especially if audio feedback accompanies those popups. It may work to eliminate popups, but it will most likely not work to eliminate confirmation questions. One way to mitigate the disruption that a pop-up can create, while maintaining sound error prevention through confirmation checks is with interactive tooltips. A tooltip is subtle enough, when tastefully designed, that it will not overtly interrupt the experience. Since users are focusing directly where the tooltip appears, discoverability is also very high. The combination of high discoverability and marginal disruption of the experience makes tooltips ideal for many error prevention designs. Let\u2019s look at applying tooltip error prevention to a photo sharing application. If one decides to edit a photo album within such an application, making sure to confirm user intent to delete photos is important. Instead of using pop-ups to display confirmation messages, let\u2019s use an interactive tooltip on the delete button.</p><p id=\"attachment_4436\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tooltip_confirmation.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-4436 \" alt=\"Tooltip Example\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tooltip_confirmation.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n\tIn the example above, error confirmation messaging has been incorporated in an unobtrusive way. There is less time and effort required to confirm intent.</p><p>\r\n\tIn some cases, especially with touch screen devices, we could make creative use of gestures for error prevention. Instead of confirming intent with a pop-up, or tooltip, we could require users to make a long swipe gesture in a highlighted area. This swipe trigger could be used in place of a tap trigger, which is final once a user interacts with it. With a swipe, users can decide to stop even after they have started swiping. Also, requiring prolonged intentional focus on the trigger activation lowers the chances of doing something by accident. A great example of this is found in the iOS7 lock and power off screens. An&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3017236/apples-ios-7-redefines-industrial-design-through-evil-skeuomorphism\">evolved form of skeuomorphism</a> is used effectively in iOS7 interaction design to make things more intuitive and faster to use. The power off screen has a \u2018slide to power off\u2019 area at the top and a cancel button all the way at the bottom as far away from the top as possible. A swipe is required to trigger a device shutdown, while simply canceling out of the shutdown screen only requires a tap. In order to even reach the shutdown screen a user must first press and hold the power button. Additionally, through the physical mechanics of the button, users receive both haptic and audio feedback as it is pressed. The subtleties of such interactions, allows for a seamless and fast experience.</p><p>\r\n\tAfter looking at the examples above, we can begin to see there is great potential to improve usage speed through simplification of interactions, user research, and more.&nbsp;Comment below if you have any suggestions or remarks about how usage speed can be improved!</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tWorking with an unfamiliar tool-set usually poses some distinct challenges. Invaluable learning takes place when you have to use that tool-set to solve a complex problem. For me, the unfamiliar tool-set was \r\n\t<a href=\"http://ellislab.com/expressionengine\">ExpressionEngine</a> and the complex problem was how best to use EE to build the <a href=\"http://design.ncsu.edu/\">NCSU College of Design</a> website.</p><p>\r\n\tComing from a largely WordPress background I was initially taken aback by some of the paradigms at the core of EE. In WordPress you have posts and custom post types, Drupal has the all powerful node and ExpressionEngine has\u2026channels. The structure of an entry is dictated by the channel it is published in and the fields that channel has. EE\u2019s content storage system is fairly straightforward when implementing a simple brochure site or blog where post types are few and their structure is simple.</p><p>\r\n\tThe College of Design site however, functions as an informational portal for the department within the larger University. On top of hundreds of informational pages across multiple sections there are staff profiles, galleries of work, dynamically generated content sliders, dynamic backgrounds \u2014 and that\u2019s just on the homepage. Well-defined content structure is important in any project and was absolutely vital in this one.</p><h3>\r\n\tThe Problem with Pages\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tAs mentioned above, most of ExpressionEngine\u2019s content management happens via channels. There is the concept of a Page in the vanilla EE install but it\u2019s disabled by default and encapsulated in a separate module. The College of Design site called for hierarchical page relationships with different templates for parent and child pages. It\u2019s a a relatively common mode of organization but proved difficult to implement with channels alone. Therefore, I was faced with an unsavory choice: build and configure the channels so all entries are easily accessible from the same template, or build a template with conditional logic for every sub-category and content type.</p><p>\r\n\tThe first option makes the front-end code much simpler but results in all the hierarchical content being chucked into the same \u201cbucket\u201d within the CMS, making actual content management a nightmare. The second option makes for templates bloated with conditional statements and hard-coded constants that are then duplicated for each section within the hierarchy. Both would solve the problem but the concessions involved in each were more than I was willing to stomach.</p><h3>\r\n\tDeus Ex Taxonomy\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tAfter the channel-based publishing, the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the plugin ecosystem. To its credit, EE is very flexible once you understand how to use it. However, like most content management systems, not all the functionality you want exists out-of-the-box. There is the possibility of extension via modules and plugins but since ExpressionEngine is proprietary software, so too are many of the plugins. Perhaps this is reasonable, but it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for someone accustomed to building with open source tools. If the WordPress Plugin Directory is a Chinese buffet,  then EE charges you $5 for water.</p><p>\r\n\tStill, despite much grumbling and dragging of feet, I eventually found my magic bullet in the form of Taxonomy. With it I was able to build hierarchical menus entirely independent of the underlying channel structure and provide override links to any URL on a per-item basis. Entries could now be organized in as many channels as necessary while appearing as one logical section to the user. At the code level I only needed to add a few template tags rather than building a self-generating menu system from the ground up.</p><p>\r\n\tBelow is the code for a custom menu on one of the departmental landing pages:</p><p>\r\n\tAs you can see, there are lots of conditionals. Additionally, there\u2019s plenty of fiddling around with URL slugs and entry IDs to get the URL structure to appear right on \u201csub\u201d pages. It works for this purpose but it\u2019s too specific to use elsewhere.</p><h3>\r\n\tEnter Taxonomy:\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tIt\u2019s much more concise to say the least. Taxonomy does all the footwork of building out sub-navs, adding active classes and handling URLs. Granted, there is still some configuration overhead and there are several options and functions that I didn\u2019t use for this build. Even so, dropping Taxonomy in was akin to sweeping that CRT monitor onto the floor and replacing it with one of those new hypercrystal OLED widescreen cinema displays. You know, the ones with the iPod dock.</p><p><em>Cover photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marfis75/\"><em>Martin Fisch</em></a><br></p>",

It would have been an extreme disappointment if the event ended \r\n\t<em style=\"background-color: initial;\">without</em> the announcement of a new product category.</p><p>\r\n\tOf course, everyone figured it would be a watch, but just like the previous announcements in 2007 and 2010, no one had any idea what it would look like or what it would do.  Apple is \r\n\t<em>very good</em> at secrecy when mass manufacturing for a product hasn't yet commenced, or when the product includes new software (as evidenced by the surprise announcement of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Swift programming language</a> in June).  Both were true in case.  Prior to the announcement, the \uf8ff Watch, as it is now known, had been produced in only limited test quantities, and the new version of iOS that it runs had never before been seen publicly.</p><p>\r\n\tThe \uf8ff Watch was announced in the context of the prior announcement of HealthKit in June.  Special emphasis has been placed on the health and fitness features of the watch, with Apple going as far as producing a \r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/films/#film-fitness\" target=\"_blank\">separate promotional video</a> highlighting this use.</p><p>\r\n\tThat said, the expectations for what this watch would do for health and fitness bordered on magical.  Sources as reliable as the Wall Street Journal predicted that the device would \"\r\n\t<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-multiple-designs-for-smartwatch-1403245062\" target=\"_blank\">include up to 10 sensors.</a>\"  With current technology, I couldn't imagine how that many high-quality sensors could be included in a 1st generation product while still maintaining a reasonable size, cost and battery life.  Sure enough, the actual product was more firmly grounded in reality, with just a single medical sensor to measure pulse, in addition to the activity tracking of the M8 chip and the new barometric functionality to measure elevation.</p><p>\r\n\tIt's quite likely that these rumors have some basis in fact, however.  The \uf8ff Watch is the most intimate product ever created by Apple, and I'm not just referring to the ability to share your heartbeat with that special someone.  It's a device that is in \r\n\t<em>constant contact with your skin</em>.  Just that fact alone opens the door for many sensors beyond simple measurement of <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/technology/\" target=\"_blank\">heart rate</a>.  In fact, I'd wager that the \uf8ff Watch could open the floodgates to R&amp;D into transcutaneous sensors, with the potential to transform how we see ourselves.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self\" target=\"_blank\">quantified self</a> has just gotten much closer to reality.</p><p>\r\n\tSo what can the \uf8ff Watch do for healthcare right now?  At the very least, the profile of wearable electronics will get a huge boost in the consumer sector.  They will become more socially acceptable, and users will come to rely on them and even \r\n\t<em>trust them</em> to make meaningful differences in their lives.  Laying this foundation now will be critical to encourage the adoption of more advanced wearable sensors in future devices.</p><p>\r\n\tHow useful the watch ends up being for consumer health and fitness will ultimately come down to the combination of hardware \r\n\t<em>and</em> software.  The fact that all of this data will be saved to HealthKit is very attractive, because the data can then be shared with <em>any </em>other HealthKit-enabled health or fitness app the user chooses.  Giving this power to the user is a smart move, and will likely foster a more open and diverse ecosystem of useful health and fitness apps moving forward.</p><p>\r\n\tWith respect to use of the \uf8ff Watch in the clinical setting, I love learning about and using new technology, but I\u2019m also cognizant that the modern reality of electronic medical records has resulted in tension within the physician-patient relationship.  During a typical visit, physicians often find themselves staring at a computer screen rather than interacting with the patient.</p><p>\r\n\tIn medical school we were taught the Latin phrase, \u201cprimum, non nocere\u201d or, \u201cfirst, do no harm.\u201d  When technology interferes with the relationship we have with our patients, harm is being done.  When technology enhances our work while remaining transparent to the interaction, we can make progress.  Technologies such as the \uf8ff Watch have the potential to take us a step in that direction by providing another avenue for relatively unobtrusive data access.  As a developer myself, I\u2019m looking forward to the arrival of the WatchKit SDK so I can see more fully how this functionality might be integrated into our medical environment, both from the perspective of a user as well as a physician.</p><h2>\"When technology interferes with the relationship we have with our patients, harm is being done. When technology enhances our work while remaining transparent to the interaction, we can make progress.\"</h2><p>\r\n\tHow could the watch be improved?  It'll be easier to see once the watch has been released and the limitations become more apparent.  But for starters, the watch needs to be waterproof.  While there's no official statement on this, \r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-watch-update-more-details-and-hands-on-97091024129.html\" target=\"_blank\">David Pogue revealed</a> that it's likely just water resistant.  I'm an avid swimmer, and one of the reasons I love my <a href=\"https://getpebble.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pebble Smartwatch</a> is because I never have to take it off (plus, it lasts up to 5-7 days per charge).  This would be critical for any users whose primary form of physical activity involves water sports.  Many of our patients who participate in cardiac rehab are often involved in water aerobics, and they would have to remove the watch to participate, thus nullifying much of the activity tracking benefit.</p><p>\r\n\tBattery life also needs to be at least several days.  I've heard some lamentations that the watch doesn't have sleep tracking functionality like some of the other popular wearables.  If the \uf8ff Watch has a battery life of only 24 hours as rumored, sleep tracking would be an&nbsp;impossibility given that the watch would need to charged at night, every night.  The watch also appears a bit too bulky in its current iteration to keep on while sleeping (in my opinion).</p><p>\r\n\tI'm confident all these issues will be resolved over time in future iterations of the watch (or competing watches).  Progress will continue and app developers will surely come up with uses that Apple hasn't even considered.  Mobile health innovators should pay close attention to this new product category.  It will eventually revolutionize how we care for our patients and ourselves.</p><p>This article&nbsp;was originally posted on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rickybloomfield.com/2014/09/watch-relevant-to-healthcare.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ricky Bloomfield's blog</a>.&nbsp;Dr. Bloomfield is the Director of Mobile Technology Strategy as well as Assistant Professor in Internal Medicine &amp; Pediatrics at Duke University.

One library I want to endorse is \r\n\t<a title=\"ViewDeck\" href=\"https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck\" target=\"_blank\">ViewDeck</a>. ViewDeck is an implementation that allows controllers to have a sliding effect, providing the same functionality seen in Path and Facebook apps. By using a natural swiping gesture, controllers can slide into view from both the left and right sides of the screen.</p><p>\r\n\tWithin about 30 minutes, I was able to properly set-up the ViewDeck library for a client project. Not only was setting-up the library quick and easy, but it looked great out of the box. What really amazed me was the customization ViewDeck allows. Depending on the iOS device running the app, you can adjust how far on-screen the controllers can be swiped. On an iPhone you\u2019re able to better utilize its lower resolution to focus on the controller being swiped into view (Fig. 1).</p><p id=\"attachment_3437\" style=\"width: 266px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n\t<img class=\" wp-image-3437 \" alt=\"Figure 1. iPhone Screenshot\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/iOS-Simulator-Screen-shot-May-9-2013-4.08.02-PM.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"384\"></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<em>Figure 1. iPhone Screenshot</em></p><p>\r\n\tWhile on the iPad, you\u2019re able to take advantage of its higher screen resolution to display both controllers (Fig. 2).</p><p id=\"attachment_3433\" style=\"width: 416px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n\t<img class=\" wp-image-3433 \" alt=\"Figure 2. iPad Screenshot\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/iOS-Simulator-Screen-shot-May-9-2013-3.42.14-PM.png\" width=\"406\" height=\"540\"></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<em>Figure 2. iPad Screenshot</em></p><p>\r\n\tBy changing the controller\u2019s size through ViewDeck, you don\u2019t have to worry about resizing the frame, it\u2019s all handled for you (especially if you use resizers on your objects).</p><p>\r\n\tHere\u2019s the code required:</p><p>\r\n\t<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3642 alignnone\" alt=\"Screenshot of ViewDeck Implementation \" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-10-at-2.12.06-PM.png\" width=\"551\" height=\"122\"></p><p>\r\n\tViewDeck also allows you to change the left and right controllers during run-time. For our example project, the run-time functionality restricts the ability to access the left or right controllers under certain conditions. For example, only granting access to the right controller on a subset of screens, but allowing the left controller to be present on every screen. The example app also features a screen dedicated to presentation mode, providing the user access to a full screen view of their document. During the full screen view, the left and right controllers are disabled so the user can interact with the document naturally. Once the user exits presentation mode, the application restores access to the left/right controllers.</p><p>\r\n\tAnother way to use ViewDeck is to customize where a swipe can occur to summon the left/right controllers. On one screen, I\u2019m using a scrollView that would normally be overridden by the gesture recognition ViewDeck uses. By using the panning property, we can apply the ViewDeck swipe gestures to specific Views and leave the rest of the screen to navigate normally. In addition to ViewDeck\u2019s default left/right controllers, the panning property allows a vertically/horizontally scrolling scrollView.</p><p>\r\n\tFeel free to leave a comment if you have any questions or want to mention a favorite iOS library that you use!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Coffeescript classes provide an easy mechanism for creating child classes of anything that uses the prototypical inheritance pattern. The \u2018<strong>extends</strong>\u2018 keyword creates a child object with it\u2019s prototype being the class methods you define. For example:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> class InfoWindow extends google.maps.InfoWindow\r\n</pre><p>New instances of InfoWindow will have a prototype object containing the methods and properties of your class. That prototype\u2019s prototype will be the prototype of the object you are extending (i.e. <strong>google.maps.InfoWindow.prototype</strong>). This allows you to augment <strong>google.maps.InfoWindow</strong> and even write methods of the same name on your child class without clobberring the parent. To access the parent\u2019s method of the same name, coffeescript provides the keyword \u2018<strong>super</strong>\u2018. For example:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> class InfoWindow extends google.maps.InfoWindow\r\n   constructor: (@_template, @_map) -&gt;\r\n   open: (context) -\r\n     super @_map, context\r\n   update: -&gt;\r\n     @setContent @_template.innerHTML\r\n</pre><p>Those familiar with google maps API will know that <strong>google.maps.InfoWindow</strong> already has a <strong>.open()</strong> method. I want to augment what that method does but I don\u2019t want to overwrite the method itself. To accomplish this, I extend <strong>google.maps.InfoWindow</strong> into my own class, define an \u2018<strong>open</strong>\u2018 method, and have it wrap the native one by using the \u2018<strong>super</strong>\u2018 keyword. This allows me to abstract away the first parameter (instance variable <strong>@_map</strong>) so I do not need to supply it each time I call <strong>.open()</strong>.</p><p>This ability to extend classes provides a clean and simple way to augment libraries you use and write code at a higher level. Happy extending!</p><p><em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<p>Last year, our company formed a partnership with a national code school called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theironyard.com/\" style=\"background-color: initial;\">The Iron Yard</a> and together we launched the first code school in Durham, North Carolina.&nbsp;I was asked to give a talk on the opening day to the 45&nbsp;students attending the academy this&nbsp;semester. This is most&nbsp;of my speech to them,&nbsp;and I believe it also holds value for anyone who is taking on a major challenge or next step in their career:</p><p>As a new CTO, I think a lot about how we grow not only our internal teams, but our community at large. I don\u2019t just want rock stars who can sit in a cubicle and crank out code. I want engaged, passionate people who seek out opportunities to learn.</p><p>When I look across this group, and after meeting many of you last night, I see that passion for learning. After all, each of you have dedicated your own time and money for the privilege of getting your butt kicked for the next three months. There\u2019s a lot to be said for that! But, as you can imagine, the journey doesn\u2019t end there. Several years ago, I was part of a group that crafted something called the <a href=\"http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/\">Software Craftsmanship Manifesto</a>. The central tenant of that manifesto was the notion that we need to treat what we do as a craft - and the learning for a craft never stops. We need to always be curious about not only our discipline, but those around us.</p><p>In fact, when you finish here and are ready to head out to the 'real world,' that ideal of curiosity is one of the four key things you\u2019ll want to hone here. Technology is changing - when I first started out, we used Basic, C++, Visual Basic, Classic ASP, Foxpro, Cold Fusion and Javascript - many which are still around today. But engineers who don\u2019t stay curious - who aren\u2019t questioning the why of things, and the what\u2019s next - may find the world, and language, they know is quite different. But for you - your curiosity is evident already - it\u2019s why you are here! Don\u2019t let that go away from you.</p><p>The other thing that struck me as so wonderful meeting you all is the passion you have. Each of you have different paths of how you got here, but in no case did I meet someone (so far!) who said, \u201cWell, I really had nothing better to do, so I figured I\u2019d just show up here and hope something happens.\u201d Instead I saw people who want to make a change, who see the power that something different can bring. People who have worked hard to rearrange things to be here, or have&nbsp;been patient waiting to get to a&nbsp;place in their lives where&nbsp;they could commit to this. <strong>And I can promise you that while there will be long hours - and hard work as your brains configure to a new way of communicating - if you remember that passion, that focus, that drive that got you here, it will see you through, and become even brighter when you make it to the end.</strong></p><p>And what about the end? I know it\u2019s hard to think about 3 months from now on your first day. But you are going to have a lot of wonderful opportunities here to build two of your most important elements - your network, and your mentors. See, I\u2019m not a \u201cclassically trained\u201d developer. I was going to become a nurse, and spent 8 years with the fire department. But my passion for technology never left. You could say that I am \u201cself-taught\u201d - but none of us actually are. The difference is that our teachers aren\u2019t giving us knowledge in classrooms in front of chalkboards. Instead they are the colleagues who tell us our code is great, and suggest improvements to make it greater. The managers who push us to go to a conference. The conference speakers who do the talk, and then chat with us in the hallway for two hours afterwards as we pester them with questions. The forum poster who guides us to cleaner code. And, for you all - your instructors, TAs, and the staff of Smashing Boxes who will work along side of you. I\u2019ve already set an internal goal for myself of spending two hours a week here, and I expect our team will be passionate about working with you all as well. Hold on to those mentors. Always see yourself as an apprentice, learning, growing. But also know that you can easily be that mentor to others - fellow students who don\u2019t understand a problem. Posters on forums you read for answers but whose question you know the answer to. Being a great mentor means being able to be a great apprentice - and you\u2019ll get the chance to do both. Just don\u2019t let Imposter Syndrome get in your way - each of you is super awesome - it\u2019s why you are here! You\u2019ll always have something to teach someone else - and don\u2019t be afraid to try!</p><p>The last thing you\u2019ll begin building here is your network. This is point I can\u2019t emphasize enough. Over the years, I\u2019ve built a network of friends and colleagues that have opened so many doors. As I mentioned earlier, I started last week as the CTO at Smashing Boxes, but it came about through a nearly seven month process that started by me reaching out to someone at Smashing Boxes for coffee to see how I could help find people for them. Starting today, you have a network of 45 people you\u2019ve immediately gained, plus your instructors, your TAs, and our staff. We can help you - in fact, we\u2019re here <em>to</em>&nbsp;help you - but you can make that even more powerful by purposefully building new connections, having new conversations, and putting yourself&nbsp;in new situations. You may know a general contractor who is looking for web site help. Or an admin assistant who could use a better expense app. Or have friends in the political science space looking for better tools to communicate to the public.</p><p>Because <strong>over the next three months, you will gain a magic power - the power to create.</strong> It\u2019s a wonderful power, and an addicting power. But the best part is the way it can be used to help others be more awesome at what they do by building things to get stuff that's in their way, out of their way. It will be a lot of work to get there, and sometimes may feel completely overwhelming. When it does, reach out to us. We\u2019ve been there. We understand. We can help you&nbsp;find ways through it. We ultimately want to see all of you succeed because while the world may not need \u201cjust more devs\u201d - it can use a group of smart, talented, curious, passionate people who have the power to create things that solve problems for the rest of us.</p>",

It's about making sure the benefits that modern times have brought us -&nbsp;wealth, knowledge, and technology -&nbsp;are translated into better health status not just for the few, the rich, and the powerful, but for everybody.\" -&nbsp;Anthony Schlaff, Director of Tuft's Public Health program</em></p><p>I love this quote, and would go further to say that technology can be used to promote social justice. Think about what Twitter accomplished during the Arab Spring. Consider how technology has helped health workers in West Africa stay safe and receive accurate information during the Ebola outbreak. The mobile phone is being used as&nbsp;a change agent around the globe. </p><p>An old military adage states that you can get two things anywhere in the world - Coca-Cola and cigarettes. Today, add talk time to that list (pay as you go minutes.) I have traveled to remote parts of the world and have seen that even in rural villages of Africa, people have cell phones. Your standard Nokia phone is everywhere - almost <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx\">95% </a>of households globally&nbsp;have access to a cell phone. While western countries took almost a century to convert from landlines to mobile, other nations&nbsp;skipped house phones as a commodity. Cellular towers provided simpler and cheaper infrastructure for connectivity, which gave the average person the ability to call for a doctor in a crisis, pay bills through mobile money systems, and stay up on the latest gossip with family members. This was big. Really big. </p><p>Now the cellular revolution is entering a second phase and the playing field is leveling more than ever. You can\u2019t tweet about the #ArabSpring with your standard feature phone. You need the Twitter app. You need a smartphone. </p><p>Once a luxury reserved for the rich, smartphones have started to become ubiquitous. By 2018,&nbsp;15% of people in Africa and the Middle East will have a smartphone. Usage in India will double to 22%. China will see an increase from 35% to more than half of their population - over 700 million people in one country. That\u2019s twice the population of the United States. And western countries will see almost their entire adult populations adopt smartphones.*</p><p><img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDIvMDIvMTMvNTgvNTIvNTUvU01BUlRfUEhPTkVfVVNBR0VfMV8ucG5nIl1d/SMART%20PHONE%20USAGE%20%281%29.png?sha=0f6d6efa\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><p>Global companies like <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/11/13/motorola-unveils-low-cost-moto-g-for-emerging-markets/\">Motorola</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-launches-low-cost-firefox-os-phone-in-india/\">Mozilla</a> have helped to usher in this change. But while Facebook and email may continue to be the most popular applications for the next few years, the opportunity is wide open for apps that aid in communicating and sharing information. Social justice just got a whole new tool to play ball. Instead of hauling stacks of paper, community health workers can now use apps with robust images to identify danger signs during the birth of a baby. Farmers can follow the stock market and consider the best time to sell their coffee for a profit. Warnings of major weather events can be quickly communicated to those in danger and crisis areas can be triangulated via cellular signals to ensure help arrives to those who need it most. </p><p>Smashing Boxes knows first hand that this isn\u2019t a dream of the future. We\u2019re working with a global organization to develop a mobile-friendly database for pharmaceutical researchers and manufacturers. Access to this information lowers the barrier to entry for developing new contraceptives from any corner of the globe, not just in big pharma labs located in western countries.

After hearing the announcement and viewing the demo we were excited to jump in and start learning more about Swift using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/recipes/xcode_help-source_editor/ExploringandEvaluatingSwiftCodeinaPlayground/ExploringandEvaluatingSwiftCodeinaPlayground.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009975-CH26\">Playground</a>. Playgrounds are used to experiment with new technologies, analyze problems, and prototype user interfaces.</p><p id=\"attachment_5268\" style=\"width: 327px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_15381.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5268  \" alt=\"Developers watching WWDC14\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_15381.jpg\" width=\"317\" height=\"423\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Developers watching WWDC14 in the new office.</p><p>Swift uses the same runtime as Objective-C under the hood, and also uses <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAutomatic_Reference_Counting&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaQBd32glc8dP7HSzlvW1RhjInQA\">Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)</a>; in fact, in the book \u201cThe Swift Programming Language,\u201d Apple suggests that a major motivation of ARC was to pave the way for Swift. Swift also offers seamless access to existing Cocoa frameworks and is fully interoperable with existing Objective-C code.</p><p>Here are some comparisons between equivalent operations in Objective-C and Swift:</p><p><strong>Array initialization:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Objective-C</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> NSArray *myArray = [[NSArray alloc] init]; </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">Swift</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">let myArray = String[]() </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">Both lines of code create an empty array using the initializer syntax.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Creating an array with items also looks quite different:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Objective-C</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> NSArray *myArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@\"one\", @\"two\", @\"three\", nil]; </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">Swift</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\"> var myArray = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"] </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">Another exciting element of Swift is how clean and easy it is to read the syntax. This allows developers to produce more maintainable code while having fun doing so.&nbsp;Additionally, Swift includes a for-in loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences. The loop can use exclusive and inclusive ranges, and parentheses are optional. Traditional for loops are also available to use as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using the for-in loop in Swift would look something like this:</strong></p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">for index in 1...5 {\r\n   println(\"index: \\(index)\")\r\n} </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">This will loop through numbers 1-5 printing what the current index is. This syntax is another way Swift has successfully increased readability making it very easy to understand what the code does. At first glance, Swift seems to bring a nice mix of syntax and features to Apple development that will likely help write concise code and express instructions in ways that that were not previously possible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most exciting parts of Swift is its functions and methods. In Swift, functions are first-class types. Compare that to Objective-C, where you have methods which must belong to a class. If you want to create a function outside of a class in Objective-C, you have to use C functions or blocks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The below example demonstrates a class that defines a simple class/type method to add two integers. Notice that Swift obviates the need for a separate interface:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Objective-C</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: objc; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">@interface MyClass : NSObject\r\n+ (INT) addValue:(INT)value1 toValue:(INT)value2;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n@implementation MyClass\r\n+ (INT) addValue:(INT)value1 toValue:(INT)value2 {\r\n   return value1 + value2;\r\n}\r\n@end </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">Swift</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">class MyClass : NSObject {\r\n   class func addValue(value: INT, toValue: INT) -&gt; INT {\r\n      return value + toValue\r\n   }\r\n} </pre><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The above demonstrates basic Swift function syntax:</strong></p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">func functionName(firstArgName: arg-type, secondArgName: arg-type) -&gt; return-type {\r\n   // code block\r\n} </pre><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Swift type method in the MyClass declaration above would be called like this:</strong></p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">var value = MyClass.addValue(5, toValue:4)\r\n// value = 9 </pre><p dir=\"ltr\">Calling the method highlights an interesting naming idiom suggested by Apple: in methods, the first parameter is not assigned an external name automatically, but subsequent parameters are, so we pass it the parameters as `5, toValue:4`. `toValue` is the external name of the second argument, and is included for clarity, to give the same readability that Objective-C does by interspersing arguments in the method name. The first parameter \u201c5\u2033 does not need an external name, because the method name itself sufficiently describes the first variable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It looks like things will get pretty fun with functions in Swift: currying, variadic arguments, multiple return values.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tWe were huddled around&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2014/\">a large, projected image of Tim Cook</a>. In true Apple fashion, there was one more thing Tim wanted us all to know&hellip; They\u2019re building a watch. It\u2019s personal. It\u2019s sleek. And we\u2019ll all have to wait a year to get it.</p><p>\r\n\tWe could have listened. Waited a year to start building CRNT for the Watch. But that wouldn\u2019t be in true Smashing Boxes fashion.</p><h5><strong>Here\u2019s the back story. </strong></h5><p>\r\n\tI\u2019m a lifelong surfer and designer.</p><p>\r\n\tMy biggest frustration when surfing is finding the current surf conditions at my favorite spots. I\u2019d call up friends or scan multiple websites. When Smashing Boxes announced \u201cLabs\u201d - off-the-clock time dedicated to exploring creative side projects - I saw an opportunity to bring my idea to life.</p><p>\r\n\tWe started by building&nbsp;<a href=\"http://crntapp.com/\">CRNT (short for current) for iPhone and Android</a>. Then Apple did it\u2019s thing: announcing another product that would change the way people experience life.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cRQP992H615qxuKfhXcsQxqkLhGyfshI2vwt04QnCN_pWtgsf7KMhlCBPM6p2n9jO2hMo0myyf5ITBouAeEhk-peEajSV6E5AGyPGIpbSLPI1vScdew0mUoitZHtnQO958M3paI\" width=\"270px;\" height=\"360px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); width: 465px;\" alt=\"WWDC14.jpg\"></p><p>\r\n\tOur team watching the Apple Watch announcement during WWDC14.</p><p>\r\n\tI should probably take a moment here to tell you that CRNT won\u2019t make us a dime. At least not this present rendition. This was an experiment. A design challenge, not a business one. Could we create software for a product that, at present, doesn\u2019t exist?</p><h5><strong>We didn\u2019t know, but we dove right in.</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe SDK wasn\u2019t immediately released but images of the Watch had been spread across the internet. I did some quick mock-ups to see if I could pull off the design on such a small screen. It looked good.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LURXCdT4BbAkFN1jyN1joLiNPy9MPVF0hXrMvylZoJolMR3empGkEChZG8VvVh2QEB7i-8z0elOTlPSPDxMXWsMUszgk6rPHx0P69K_TJU7hWawWFf9_qatkvPi6mt_bQUdL2fY\" width=\"575px;\" height=\"430px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad);\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<em>My initial mock-up where I thought the screen would stretch to the edge of the watch face. In the beginning, everything was a guess. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<em><br>\r\n\t</em></p><p>\r\n\tIt helped that we had started with a minimalist app for iPhone and Android. The simplicity of the previous design made translating it from phone to watch relatively easy. Of course, I\u2019d be amiss to say it was all smooth sailing. The Watch posed new constraints.</p><p>\r\n\tThe primary challenge was designing for something that was largely unknown and untested. We didn\u2019t have a physical object to test our ideas on. Viewing the designs on a monitor, we didn\u2019t even know if our images were to scale. We had no idea if the functionality that was revealed at the conference would be the same functionality available once the SDK was released.</p><p>\r\n\tWe had to be creative and flexible.</p><p>\r\n\tWould there be glare on the screen in the sun? How would transitions appear? Would there be transitions at all? Was the sky the limit, or would we be severely constrained?</p><p>\r\n\tWe didn\u2019t know. We had to dream up all the potential variables that could impact the end product. And I am certain there are several that we missed.</p><p>\r\n\tOnce the SDK was released and we had more information to work with, we took several of our ideas and designs back to the drawing board. We still haven\u2019t tested our app on the Watch and there will be many iterations to come to make it perfect. Never-the-less, we\u2019ve learned quite a bit.</p><p>\r\n\tHere\u2019s how we tackled it.</p><h5><strong>Go simple.</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThe Apple Watch enforces simplicity; it has to be simple to be effective. With the Watch, the user must be able to execute an action or pickup content in a few seconds or it's going to fail. That\u2019s your sniff test.</p><p>\r\n\tI approached designing for CRNT as if I were drawing in the sand. When you strip down all of the details and break it into segments that are simple enough to communicate in sand, you\u2019ve hopefully achieved something minimal, functional, and memorable for the user.</p><h5><strong>A team always beats going it alone.</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tIt\u2019s important I mention that I didn\u2019t do all of this alone. I had an amazing team of designers, developers, and marketers working alongside me to bring this app to life and then share it with the world. I also had the immense support of our founders, Brian Fischer and Nick Jordan.</p><p>\r\n\tEveryone who was part of this project volunteered their expertise and enthusiasm, and CRNT only exists due to their efforts. Do yourself a favor, and find a great team.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/99PVOZuyz1piE12E_zzgCrcPz5xYuiA90ndQyvYMTPk0zKL6OSdI5XBvZF_YyXf-OjTg3DA25RSfss5wiwHPoNlsoLz88t0oJNXCRmWE0Jb7zAgT2FF2VDZMAG2Pw8EnPMbJYiA\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"409px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); width: 1129px;\" alt=\"_DSC3781.jpg\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<em>From top left to bottom right - Austin Lanier (Android Developer), Margaret McNab (Dir. of Growth), Raleigh Felton (Dir. of Design), Lucas Brauer (UX Designer), Bret Kruse (Developer &amp; Interactive Designer), David Melgar (iOS Developer), David Sweetman (iOS Developer), Alicia Midland&nbsp;(Growth Engineer), Laura Smith (Community Manager). Not pictured but also played a huge part: Helen Vasconcelos (Back-End &amp; iOS Developer), Andrew Folwer (QA Specialist),&nbsp;Jordan Clifton (iOS Developer).&nbsp;</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><h5><strong>It\u2019s not a reduction game.</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tIt would have been easy to scrunch the design down into an inch by inch square, but it wouldn\u2019t have worked. The Watch demands the removal of complementary content so smart user experience design was crucial.</p><p>\r\n\tEven though we were translating a simple and uncluttered app from phone to watch, we had to further refine our goals and focus on what mattered most. I can\u2019t understate how crucial this is. With the watch you are not building an app, you are creating an action.</p><h5><strong>Cut visual affordances. </strong></h5><p>\r\n\tIt's not only about designing something cool; it's also about designing something useful. You don\u2019t need to style buttons. With the Watch, information is the interface.</p><h5><strong>Consider potential constraints. </strong></h5><p>\r\n\tThis will be much easier for those building for the Watch after it\u2019s released, but regardless, it will still help you to consider the variables and constraints of this platform.</p><p>\r\n\tFor instance, the Watch may not always used in a stationary or indoor environment so contrast might need to be a consideration. Elements (such as text) must be large, clear, and readable with enough contrast for the user to \u2018get it\u2019 without having to work for it.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDQvMjIvMTEvNDIvNDUvNjE0LzU1MmJkY2MyNzI5ZjBjYWUwOGFmN2I4N18xNDI4OTM3OTIyNjgxLmpwZyJdXQ/552bdcc2729f0cae08af7b87-1428937922681.jpg?sha=9ead1914\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<em>The phone application has white text and icons on a sky blue screen. For the Watch, we chose a black background with light blue lettering to create greater contrast.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<strong><br>\r\n\t</strong></p><h5><strong>There\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know. </strong></h5><p>\r\n\tBuilding for the Watch before the Watch was released was a process riddled with guessing and questioning. We don\u2019t know what this is yet or how users will react - both to the Watch and to CRNT.</p><p>\r\n\tUltimately, just as Apple will have much to learn from the initial release of the Watch, app creators like us will also face multiple iterations to get it right. Playing with our app on the Watch after release is likely to be a humbling experience. We\u2019ve created a buzzworthy app for a product we\u2019ve never touched.  So far, CRNT has been featured in <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/03/09/apple-watch-apps-2/\">Mashable</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wareable.com/apple-watch/best-apple-watch-apps-832\">Wearable</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/app-design/how-apple-watch-will-change-apps-forever-31514563\">Creative Bloq</a>.</p><p>\r\n\tYet amidst all of the unknowns, one thing is certain: the Watch is about simplicity. To be successful, you have to focus, refine, and prioritize what really matters.</p><p><em>\r\n\tDownload CRNT on Android, iOS, and the Apple Watch by the end of the month.&nbsp;</em></p><p>*This article was originally published in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.exitevent.com/article/how-smashing-boxes-built-an-app-for-the-apple-watch-150413\">ExitEvent</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

One of the main differentiator between it and others (ex:&nbsp;carrierwave) instead of making thumbnails at upload,&nbsp;images are resized when they are first&nbsp;rendered. Then they are <strong>cached</strong>. In other words, it allows for on the fly image processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some gotchas to lookout for.</p><h2>\r\n\t<strong>Gotcha #1:&nbsp;Caching / Performance</strong></h2><p>\r\n\t\t\tDragonfly generates images on the fly. In order to keep processing low, it needs to store the resulting images in some sort of cache. From the dragonfly docs we read:</p><blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tSimply put a proxy like \r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache\">Rack::Cache</a>, <a href=\"http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/\">Varnish</a> or <a href=\"http://www.squid-cache.org/\">Squid</a> in front of the app and subsequent requests will be served super-quickly straight out of the cache.<br>\r\n\t\t\t\tFor simple use of Rack::Cache with rails see \r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/rails#caching\">Rails</a>.\r\n\t</p></blockquote><p>\r\n\t\t\tUsing Rack::Cache with memcached is not recommended in production, especially if there are lots of images or these images are large in size. If you do use Rack::Cache, make sure to change the memcached file size limit (1MB by default).</p><p>\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Rack::Cache</strong> ships with three different storage engines: \r\n\t<code>file</code>, <code>heap</code>, and <code>memcache</code>. Storing data in the <code>file</code> engine is slower but memory efficient. Using <code>heap</code> means your process\u2019 memory will be used which is quicker but can have an impact on performance if it grows unbounded. Using <code>memcache</code> is the fastest option though it isn\u2019t well suited to store large objects.&nbsp;Heroku recommends using the MetaStore with the memcache storage engine, which allows very quick access to shared meta-data, while using the file engine for the EntityStore and its larger objects results in an efficient and predictable application performance profile.</p>\r\n<pre>config.action_dispatch.rack_cache = {\r\n    :metastore    =&gt; 'memcached://localhost:11211/meta',\r\n    :entitystore =&gt;  URI.encode(\"file:#{Rails.root}/tmp/dragonfly/cache/body\")\r\n}\r\nconfig.static_cache_control = \"public, max-age=2592000\"\r\n</pre><p>&nbsp;See&nbsp;\r\n\t<a href=\"http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/storage\">Rack Cache Storage</a> for all the rack::cache configuration options.</p><p>The alternative is to use a <strong>CDN</strong>:</p><blockquote>\r\n\tHeroku recommends using a \r\n\t<a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-amazon-cloudfront-cdn\">CDN to speed up delivery of assets</a> for the fastest visitor experience. If you are already using a CDN, then adding <code>Rack::Cache</code> will not speed up delivery of assets.

        "body": "<p>\r\n\tLike any self-respecting small business, Smashing Boxes is working on its LinkedIn presence. When sharing posts from the SB blog to the LinkedIn company page we noticed that some images were cropped smack in the center. LinkedIn does not have an image cropping tool so there is no way to control the image preview. Unless images were marked as the \u201cFeatured Image\u201d within WordPress, the thumbnails created by LinkedIn were pixelated and distorted. By attempting to solve the thumbnail issue we discovered a couple of workarounds.</p><p id=\"attachment_3225\" style=\"width: 497px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smashing-Boxes-Overview-LinkedIn.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3225\" alt=\"LKND Stealz Distorted Image\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smashing-Boxes-Overview-LinkedIn.png\" width=\"487\" height=\"192\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n\tDue to the centering of LinkedIn\u2019s crop, the Stealz logo is missing a few elements.</p><p>\r\n\t<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3147\" style=\"opacity: 0;\" alt=\"linkedin\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/linkedin.jpeg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p><h3>Solution 1&nbsp;(decent)</h3><p>\r\n\tAfter a little sleuthing, it appears LinkedIn pulls in the first two pictures from shared WordPress posts. In order for pictures to appear as expected on LinkedIn we would have to upload an image that meets the LinkedIn thumbnail dimensions of 180 X 110. Considering the small size, inserting an image optimized for LinkedIn might not work well with the rest of the post\u2019s content.</p><p>\r\n\tThe small image problem can be solved with a little tinkering. Once your image is scaled down and inserted into your post, change its width to 1 and the height to 1. Also, add a style of opacity 0 to your image, which will hide it completely. The new width, height, and opacity will ensure there is not a huge chunk of white space within your WordPress post. After publishing your post and sharing the url on LinkedIn, you should have a non pixelated, non stretched image as the thumbnail:</p><p id=\"attachment_3230\" style=\"width: 518px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smashing-Boxes-Overview-LinkedIn2.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3230 \" alt=\"LKND Optimized Stealz Image\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Smashing-Boxes-Overview-LinkedIn2.png\" width=\"508\" height=\"170\"></a></p><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\r\n\tAfter applying our first workaround, the thumbnail displays as intended.</p><p>\r\n\tHere\u2019s the code for Solution 1:</p>\r\n<pre><img style=\"opacity: 0;\" alt=\"stealz3\" src=\"&lt;a href=\" http:=\"\" placehold.it=\"\" 180x110\"width=\"1\" \"=\"\"><a href=\"http://placehold.it/180x110\" width=\"1\" \"=\"\">http://placehold.it/180x110\"width=\"1\"</a> height=\"1\" /&gt;<br>\r\n</pre><h3>\r\nSolution 2&nbsp;(better)\r\n</h3><p>\r\n\tWhile the first solution works as a quick fix, if you\u2019re a styling perfectionist the previous work around may prove to be a little too hacky. Even though we made the image \u201cdisappear\u201d, it\u2019s still in the DOM and may cause more white space between paragraphs than wanted. Fortunately, we discovered a more stable (and intricate) fix which we are using on this very post.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>Open Graph and WordPress Meta box</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">The Open Graph</a> protocol&nbsp;is a single technology that provides information to represent your webpage. Using Open Graph meta tags allow developers more control over how a piece of shared content is displayed on social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google +, making it handy for cross-platform social strategies.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>Adding Open Graph to your WordPress theme</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tAs noted above, Open Graph tags have to be added within the HEAD tags. So we added the following code to our Header.php file:</p>\r\n<pre>&lt;meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"\"/&gt;&lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tBy looking at the tags we can intuit their meaning: Og:url is the url of the post/page, Og:title is the title of the post or page, Og:description is the description of the content we are presenting, Og:type is the type of content (e.g., \u201carticle\u201d or \u201cvideo\u201d), and Og:image is the url of the image you wish to describe/show.</p><p>\r\n\tFor a static HTML file we could simply hardcode the content.&nbsp;In other words we could put</p>\r\n<pre>&lt;meta property=\u201dog:title\u201d content=\u201dHow to implement Open Graph with WordPress\u201c/&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tinto the HEAD of a page and that title will appear when it is shared. Because WordPress pages are dynamic PHP code, that technique does not apply. Instead, the content of the meta tag will depend on the page or post. Using WordPress template tags to dynamically populate the metadata we get the following:</p>\r\n<pre>&lt;meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"&lt;?php the_title(); ?&gt;\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"&lt;?php echo strip_tags(get_the_excerpt($post-&gt;ID)); ?&gt;\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"&lt;?php echo wp_get_attachment_url(get_post_thumbnail_id($post-&gt;ID)); ?&gt;\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tThe highlighted code tells WordPress, \u201cIf I\u2019m on the \u2018Home\u2019 page, output the homepage url, title, description, and featured image\u201d, \u201cIf I\u2019m on the \u2018About\u2019 page, output the data related to the about page.\u201d</p><p>\r\n\tFrom now on we\u2019ll focus on the og:image tag since it\u2019s where social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook pull image data from.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>Featured Image, to be or not to be?</strong>\r\n</h5><p>\r\n\tThe code above retrieves the selected featured image and inserts it into the og:image tag. What if you don\u2019t always want to display a featured image? If you repost every piece of content from your blog onto a social network without selecting a featured image, the result will be no content pulled into the og:image tag. The solution is to always add a featured image with the option to choose whether or not to display it.</p><p>\r\n\tIn order to accomplish the stated goal of providing an option to display or hide the featured image within a post, we first made a meta box. Let\u2019s grab a generic one from the WordPress codex:</p>\r\n<pre>/* Define the custom box */\r\nadd_action( \u2018add_meta_boxes\u2019, \u2018myplugin_add_custom_box\u2019 );\r\n/* Do something with the data entered */\r\nadd_action( \u2018save_post\u2019, \u2018myplugin_save_postdata\u2019 );\r\n/* Adds a box to the main column on the Post and Page edit screens */\r\nfunction myplugin_add_custom_box() {\r\n$screens = array( \u2018post\u2019);\r\nforeach ($screens as $screen) {\r\nadd_meta_box(\r\n\u2018myplugin_sectionid\u2019,\r\n__( \u2018My Post Section Title\u2019, \u2018myplugin_textdomain\u2019 ),\r\n\u2018myplugin_inner_custom_box\u2019,\r\n$screen\r\n);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n/* When the post is saved, save our custom data */\r\nfunction myplugin_save_postdata( $post_id ) {\r\n// First we need to check if the current user is authorised to do this action.\r\nif ( \u2018page\u2019 == $_POST['post_type'] ) {\r\nif ( ! current_user_can( \u2018edit_page\u2019, $post_id ) )\r\nreturn;\r\n} else {\r\nif ( ! current_user_can( \u2018edit_post\u2019, $post_id ) )\r\nreturn;\r\n}\r\n// Second we need to check if the user intended to change this value.\r\nif ( ! isset( $_POST['myplugin_noncename'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['myplugin_noncename'], plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) ) )\r\nreturn;\r\n// Third we can save the value to the database\r\n//if saving in a custom table, get \u201c\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d\"post_ID\r\n$post_ID\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d\"\u201d = $_POST['post_ID'];\r\n//sanitize user input\r\n$mydata = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['myplugin_new_field'] );\r\n// Do something with $mydata\r\n// either using\r\nadd_post_meta($post_ID, \u2018_my_meta_value_key\u2019, $mydata, true) or\r\nupdate_post_meta($post_ID, \u2018_my_meta_value_key\u2019, $mydata);\r\n}\r\n/* Prints the box content */\r\nfunction myplugin_inner_custom_box( $post ) {\r\n// Use nonce for verification\r\nwp_nonce_field( plugin_basename( __FILE__ ), \u2018myplugin_noncename\u2019 );\r\n// The actual fields for data entry\r\n// Use get_post_meta to retrieve an existing value from the database and use the value for the //form\r\n$value = get_post_meta( $_POST['post_ID'], $key = \u2018_my_meta_value_key\u2019, $single = true );\r\necho \u2018&lt;label for=\u201dmyplugin_new_field\u201d&gt;\u2019;\r\n_e(\u201cTo Show featured image type, \u2018show\u2019 \u201c, \u2018myplugin_textdomain\u2019 );\r\necho \u2018&lt;/label&gt; \u2018;\r\necho \u2018&lt;input type=\u201dtext\u201d id=\u201dmyplugin_new_field\u201d name=\u201dmyplugin_new_field\u201d value=\u201d\u2018.esc_attr($value).\u2019\u201d size=\u201d25\u2033 /&gt;\u2019;\r\n}\r\n?&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tAfter adding the above sequence to functions.php in your theme, notice you now have a meta box in your posts. Now let\u2019s configure it to give us the option to display or hide the featured image.&nbsp;Notice the code in the red, the \r\n\t<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">$value </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">is the variable that points to the content we type in our &nbsp;meta box.&nbsp;</span>We can use that value to decide whether or not we want to show the featured image.</p><p>\r\n\tIn your template find where the featured image is displayed. Generally, the image will be in the single.php file of your theme, but it may be in more than one location. For our purposes we just want the option to display or hide the featured image on a single post, which will be the single.php file in your template.</p><p>\r\n\tThe featured image syntax, once located, will typically look like the following:</p>\r\n<pre>&lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tNow edit the code to work with the meta box.</p>\r\n<pre>&lt;?php\r\n//Get the value\r\n$value = get_post_meta(get_the_ID(), $key = \u2018_my_meta_value_key\u2019, $single = true );\r\n//If the value is show\r\nif ($value == \u2018show\u2019) {\r\n//Show the thumbnail\r\nthe_post_thumbnail();\r\n}\r\n?&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n</pre><p>\r\n\tThe code above retrieves the value of the meta box and if the value is \u201cshow\u201d, it will display the featured image. If the \u201cshow\u201d text is not in the meta box the featured image will not display, but the image\u2019s information will still be pulled into the og:image tag.</p><p>\r\n\tThe workaround allows WordPress users to display or hide featured images by manipulating the og:image tag. By incorporating Open Graph, users allow social networks to display their featured images as appropriately scaled thumbnails.</p><p>\r\n\t<em style=\"background-color: initial;\">Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<p>Why is securing funding for a startup so difficult? That was the question Jon Spinney and Sean Steigerwal had on their minds come graduation time from NC State's School of Business. They saw fresh-faced and wide-eyed entrepreneurs like themselves had all the tools to start a business - the education, the plan, the strategies, and sometimes the product - but no money or source of revenue.</p><h5><strong>The Challenge of Funding</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tSean and Jon\u2019s situation isn\u2019t an isolated predicament. Getting funding is seen as a necessary evil for startup founders; something you just have to get through. But it\u2019s hard, especially for startups in the local area.</p><p>\r\n\tThe entrepreneurial community in the Triangle is strong. Universities, coworking spaces and young businesses like ourselves are all working to foster the growth of this community. But we still have a ways to go to compete with the country's largest tech hubs. So, how do we get there?</p><p>\r\n\tBy raising capital.</p><p>\r\n\tThe area has seen a lack of capital available for early-stage businesses, which has pushed some to seek out bigger cities a larger venture scene. In my nearly five years in the local startup scene, I have seen many great ideas stall or not grow nearly as large as they could have because of difficulty in raising funds.</p><p>\r\n\tThats a tough pill to swallow for a fellow entrepreneur. There\u2019s nothing worse than when a company that has been founded by North Carolina natives picks up and moves to the West Coast, or cities like Boston, because that\u2019s where the money is. We want to be a successful entrepreneurial hub, so we need to keep these people, and their companies, here.</p><h5><strong>A New Idea Based on a Common Trend</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tIn 2013, Jon and Sean dreamt up the idea for Malartu, a website that would allow investors to pick and choose the startups they fund. They came to us to design and deliver the final product. To best do this, we had casual, informal conversations with local startups and investors. Our biggest takeaway was that these investors invest in their community to grow their community.</p><p>\r\n\tWith <a href=\"https://malartufunds.us/preview\">Malartu</a>, startups can list their company on the site and certified investors can browse through and choose to invest in a limited number of infant businesses. It allows N.C. startups to raise $50,000 to $1,000,000, and accredited investors can put as little as $1,000 into a company.  Like a traditional crowdfunding initiative, Malartu allows multiple investors to invest in one company, it just doesn\u2019t have to be at the same time or altogether.</p><p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FKTanilTICbpMQTUFeBnOcxeMIWlhXuZkF8aA1AHphmOU72u5eIgO3lAjylJIHK-2P-S8-u95mXgISaI_A1GMEIUTM_69tw6_cxSQOD5TrPuZx4FX82N_yWTu-gznZ61M-CYQCw\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"357px;\" style=\"border-style: none; transform: rotate(0rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin: auto;\" alt=\"laptop-a16c8b4d0ee7cb0986646d6c54c67955.png\"></p><p>\r\n\tEarly adopters to this kind of equity crowdfunding have the power to enable many more startups and thus change the traditional ways capital is raised. With these types of crowdfunding initiatives, there\u2019s a domino effect, empowering one company to empower another, and another, and so forth.</p><h5><strong>The Answer to An Ongoing Problem? Maybe.</strong></h5><p>\r\n\tSeveral weeks ago, the North Carolina Senate filed a new bill called PACES (Providing Access To Entrepreneurs/Small Business). With the passage of the bill, anyone can invest up to $5,000 into a startup company in exchange for equity.</p><p>\r\n\tAs of now, this is something investors can\u2019t currently do unless they are \u201caccredited,\u201d meaning they have a net worth of $1 million or more or have earned $200,000 ($300,00 with a spouse) for the last two years or more.</p><p>\r\n\tThe only way to turn around the problem of funding is to get more capital investment, and more success stories, keeping more of the winners here to make more investments. I don\u2019t think that N.C. PACES will turn this around all by itself, but it\u2019s a start.</p><p>\r\n\tFor small businesses and startups, this bill and investment initiatives like Malartu support the entrepreneurial spirit that has been the backbone to both their inspiration and success. Only time will tell, but entrepreneurs like Jon and Sean are optimistic. It\u2019s the hope that these actions will light a fire under the entrepreneurial spirit of our local community and keep it burning into the future.</p><p>\r\n\t<em>Editor\u2019s Note:<br>\r\n\t</em></p><p>\r\n\t<em>You can have a voice in making this happen. Call your State Senator or General Assembly representative. Tell them you want to make this bill a reality and you don\u2019t want it caught up in the politics that have killed the initiative in previous years.

While management isn\u2019t always the sexiest position in a creative agency \u2013 it\u2019s often one of the most critical roles in delivering successful projects in both the eyes of the client and the agency.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/refreshthetriangle/\"><img class=\" wp-image-4522 \" alt=\"Refresh the Triangle Meetup\" src=\"http://sbblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Meetup.jpg\" width=\"387\" height=\"216\"></a></p><h3>\r\nSo what should you know about project management?\r\n</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo be a project manager is to walk a tightrope everyday \u2013 balancing the needs of many clients against the needs of the business, and individuals within the business. Managing timelines, budgets, and scope creep are obvious aspects of the job, but the difference between good and great project managers can be seen in these skills:</p><h5>\r\n<strong>1. The gift of foresight</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhat are the risk factors for a project? How can we mitigate them now? How can we communicate them now to set different expectations? These are the questions that every manager should ask at the beginning of the project, and then continuously pose throughout the project process. Accounting for \r\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law\">Murphy\u2019s Law</a> is a fundamental responsibility of the PM.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>2. The ability to have difficult conversations</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tDelivering bad news clients can be incredibly intimidating, but the ability to identify problems and openly discuss them with stakeholders is a key skill of any project manager. Clients may not be happy about a project item, but they will appreciate knowing the reality of the situation sooner rather than later. Don\u2019t let issues remain undiscussed \u2013 bring them up as soon as possible, but offer solid reasoning and alternatives if possible.</p><h5>\r\n<strong>3. Empathy &amp; understanding</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAside from managing client expectations, project managers are also managing internal teams. Managing people is an inherently difficult task; people have emotional and physical needs \u2013 and everyone is motivated in different ways. Getting to know team members personally will help managers understand what makes each person tick. This puts PM\u2019s in a better position to create cohesive teams with knowledge of everyone\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and better yet create camaraderie that will get the team through difficult situations that arise from difficult conversations \u2013 see item #2!</p><h5>\r\n<strong>4. Knowing when to step back</strong>\r\n</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tGetting to know a team\u2019s strengths will help in situations where it\u2019s necessary to admit that the team knows better.  It\u2019s not a manager\u2019s job to know how to program or design (although basic skills are a plus) \u2013 but it is necessary to know when to listen to the expertise of the team to guide decision making. In those instances \u2013 get out of the way; let the team do what they do best.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNot in a project management role, and wondering how you can get your current manager to build these skills and traits? Talk to them; project managers thrive on communication! Try to phrase the conversation in terms of how you can improve as a team to avoid personal attacks. If you\u2019re noticing build ups to catastrophic project moments that are preventable \u2013 start taking the foresight lead in bringing them to your manager\u2019s attention.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIf you\u2019re a junior PM, you can start building these skills at any point during current projects. These habits often come only through learning by mistake or projects gone awry. Check in with yourself periodically to ask what you could have done differently and don\u2019t be afraid to ask your team members for advice on how you can improve.</p><p>\r\n\tThanks to our wonderful panelists who inspired and informed:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1087102&amp;authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK&amp;authToken=HoHm&amp;trk=extra_biz_connect_hb_upphoto\">Jeffrey Donahoe</a><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1087102&amp;authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK&amp;authToken=HoHm&amp;trk=extra_biz_connect_hb_upphoto\"><br></a></li><li><a href=\"http://agencyfirebox.com/\">Karl Sakas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=6462683&amp;authType=OPENLINK&amp;authToken=atBI&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=958191911386717318746&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=4&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A958191911386717318746%2CVSRPtargetId%3A6462683%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary\">Marc Minor</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4796934&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=RGeQ&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=958191911386717329649&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=4&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A958191911386717329649%2CVSRPtargetId%3A4796934%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary\">Tera Simon</a></li></ul><p><br></p>",

        "body": "<p><a title=\"Spree eCommerce\" href=\"http://spreecommerce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spree</a> is an&nbsp;open-source eCommerce solution built on top of Ruby on Rails. It is fairly simple to extend, however building and modifying the front-end can be somewhat of a chore.</p><p>I\u2019m going to start with the assumption that you have already have an existing Spree installation. If you aren\u2019t acquainted with the installation process, Spree provides an excellent guide <a title=\"Getting Started With Spree\" href=\"http://guides.spreecommerce.com/getting_started.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><h3>Speed things up</h3><p>Before doing any styling, I wanted to recommend the inclusion of <a title=\"Active Reload Gem\" href=\"https://github.com/paneq/active_reload\">active_reload</a> in your Gemfile. Since Spree hasn\u2019t made the jump to Rails 3.1, asset compilation can make changing the appearance of a Spree site frustrating. Active_reload adds some additional intelligence to the recompilation process, and is baked in to Rails 3.2.</p><h3>Changing Markup</h3><p>Through the asset pipeline, Spree makes it dead simple to manipulate stylesheets. To directly effect markup Spree provides two options. First, templates can be overridden&nbsp;by placing matching templates within the app/views directory of your application. For example to overide the product page simply:</p><ol>\r\n<li>Visit Spree\u2019s Github Page</li><li>View&nbsp;<em>core/app/views/spree/products/show.html.erb</em>\r\n</li><li>Copy the code into <em>app/views/spree/products/show.html.erb</em>\r\n</li></ol><p>Couldn\u2019t be easier. However this mitigates any work done by the Spree team on such templates, be it bug fixes or additional functionality. The preferred method to change Spree markup is through the <a title=\"Deface Gem on Github\" href=\"https://github.com/railsdog/deface\">Deface</a> gem.</p><h3>Defacing Your Application</h3><p>Deface allows you to modify template data after it has been rendered using CSS3 selectors. Let\u2019s do some initial setup for altering Spree with Deface.</p><ol>\r\n<li>Add Deface to your Gemfile</li><li>Bundle it</li><li>Make an \u201cOverrides\u201d directory under /app</li></ol><p><a title=\"Spree's Source Code\" href=\"https://github.com/spree/spree\" target=\"_blank\">Spree\u2019s source code</a> is a&nbsp;great companion when making changes. Be sure to swap Spree\u2019s github branch to 1.0-stable (or whatever you happen to be using).</p><p>Let\u2019s look at a some example code:</p>\r\n<pre># For this particular project, we needed to add an additional navigation bar\r\nDeface::Override.new(:virtual_path =&gt; \"layouts/spree_application\",\r\n :name =&gt; \"add_secondary_navigation\",\r\n :insert_after =&gt; \"#nav-bar\",\r\n :partial =&gt; \"shared/navigation\")</pre><p>Here we tell Deface to take the output from layouts/spree_application and add a partial after the DOM element with an ID of #nav-bar. The resulting code is easier to maintain, because we don\u2019t have to worry about checking on every Spree update to see if any changes were made to the core layout file.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>Styling Spree applications can be a breeze once one becomes&nbsp;acquainted&nbsp;with the environment. Aim on the side of caution when editing templates and use Deface wherever possible. Doing so will help you to build great experiences without hurting future releases.</p><p><em>Smashing Boxes is a web and mobile app development company know for creating a lasting experience through bold design and disrupting the status quo.

        "body": "<p>When we think about experiences in a digital context we generally consider what a person thinks and feels as they navigate through a website or app. A person\u2019s experience with a service or product takes shape during moments of engagement - or touch points - that trigger emotional reactions. In turn, these experiences sculpt the way they think and feel about a brand. It is the task of experience designers to identify and improve - or altogether create - these touch points that lead to a positive experience for the user.</p><p>\r\n\tOutside of the digital realm, designed experiences are pervasive; we just don't always notice them. Museums, theatre, music, architecture, amusement parks, and even<a href=\"http://Close tie between Amsterdam and Prague but I think Prague takes the cake.\"> entire cities</a> are designed with some degree of intention. The goal may be to connect with people, add greater meaning to their lives, or to foster a sense of affinity for a brand or institution. But do people forging experiences outside of the digital realm go about it in the same way? Or is there a thing or two that we, in the digital world, could learn from them?</p><p>\r\n\tThis is what Dante and I were pondering when we came up with the idea of the Experience Smashcast. As a company, our approach embraces technology as a part of the broader customer experience - customer relationships, support, marketing, design - these things all contribute to the larger ecosystem of the user experience. With this in mind, we wanted to see how, why, and with what, others are crafting powerful, human experiences beyond digital. And, from a selfish point of view, we knew we would benefit from understanding different perspectives on experience design, with the hope that those benefits would carry over to our own clients.</p><p>\r\n\tI can't remember who thought of it first, but Marbles Kids Museum resonated with both of us. Even if you're simply meandering around downtown Raleigh, the architecture of the building is an experience in itself. There's an odd, pointy glass structure where people can walk out over the sidewalk and look out onto the park next door. On the adjacent side stands a tall, purple iron gate with a fountain behind it. And rising high from the roof, a large half sphere of glass windows. Indoors, the architecture is whimsical and inspiring, making you feel like you're a kid again.</p><p>\r\n\tSo we reached out. And to our surprise and delight (we weren't sure how seriously people would take our off-the-cuff idea) members of the leadership team&nbsp;were thrilled to talk with us about what goes into creating \"the Marbles experience\u201d and what they\u2019re all about.</p><p>\r\n\tWe had so many questions for them. We wanted to know about their philosophy and vision, their process, how their process informs their culture. Do they do 'user' research? Do they test prototypes? Where do they draw inspiration and how do they keep themselves fresh? This episode of the Smashcast holds the answers to those questions, but more importantly, it's an inspiration. And not just for experience designers, but for anyone who is a human.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189319575&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe><p>\r\n\tWhat did you think?
